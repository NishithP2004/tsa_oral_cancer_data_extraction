The radial longitudinal skin incision given and performed lateral-to-medial subfascial  dissection over the large brachioradialis. The dorsal radial nerve is preserved. Brachioradialis tendon is widely undermined the and retracted it laterally. The radial artery pedicle is dissected distally. The cephalic vein is included in the harvest. Fasciocutaneous paddle is pedicled by only the lateral intermuscular septum and the radial artery pedicle. Proximally,  incision from the skin paddle to the antecubital fossa is given.
