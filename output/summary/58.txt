This patient is a 71-year-old male who underwent surgery on August 7, 2015, for a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the floor of his mouth. The initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Pathological examination revealed a T2 stage tumor. Critically, the pathology also indicated an N0 nodal status, meaning no detectable cancer cells in the regional lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was not administered. A follow-up examination on August 12, 2016, reported no evidence of disease. Despite the initial T2 classification and N0 nodal status, the clinical course is encouraging, demonstrating no recurrence at the last documented follow-up.
