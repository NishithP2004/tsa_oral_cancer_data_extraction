This patient is a 41-year-old male who presented with a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on 5/28/2016. The initial surgical intervention involved a modified radical neck dissection, performed bilaterally. Pathology revealed a T3 stage tumor. Despite this, nodal staging according to the 8th edition indicated N3b disease, suggesting extensive spread. The patient received no adjuvant therapy following the initial surgery. Last follow-up was recorded on 1/17/2019, at which point the patient was documented as being ‘Died With Disease’. This case represents a challenging presentation of oral cancer with significant regional nodal involvement, ultimately resulting in a poor prognosis.
