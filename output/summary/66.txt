This 50-year-old male presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on June 14, 2018. Initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concern for metastasis. Pathological examination revealed an aggressive tumor, classified as T4a and N2c/N3b according to the 8th edition clinical tumor staging system. The tumor was located on the tongue. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. Despite treatment, the patient succumbed to the disease, with confirmation of disease progression at the last follow-up on December 7, 2020. The final pathological staging confirmed a significant extent of the disease, including involvement of the neck lymph nodes.
