This patient is a 56-year-old female presenting with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma originating in the alveolus. The tumor was initially diagnosed and surgically treated on January 31, 2017, with a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Pathological staging, according to the 8th Edition, indicated a T4a tumor and an N0 nodal status, signifying extensive local invasion and no detectable nodal involvement at the time of surgery. Following the initial surgery, adjuvant therapy was administered. A final follow-up on March 14, 2017, revealed no evidence of disease. Therefore, at the last documented follow-up, the patient was considered to be in complete remission.
