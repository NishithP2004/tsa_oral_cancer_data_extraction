This patient is a 40-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on October 7, 2013. The tumor was classified as T3, indicating a larger tumor size and extension beyond the tongue itself. Due to the clinical staging, a selective neck dissection was performed. Pathological examination revealed no nodal involvement (N0). Following surgery, the patient received no adjuvant therapy. The last follow-up on January 24, 2014, reported no evidence of disease. This suggests an initial successful treatment outcome with no recurrence detected within the timeframe of observation.
