This 47-year-old male presented with a diagnosis of moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, initially identified through surgical resection performed on March 24, 2015. The tumor was classified as T4a, indicating extensive local invasion, and N2a, signifying involvement of level II and III lymph nodes in the neck. A selective neck dissection was conducted at the time of surgery. Pathological examination revealed a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Despite the initial surgical intervention and neck dissection, the patient progressed with disease. A final follow-up assessment conducted on June 20, 2016, unfortunately revealed the patient was lost to disease. This case highlights the aggressive nature of this cancer and the importance of aggressive adjuvant therapy, which was not utilized in this instance.
