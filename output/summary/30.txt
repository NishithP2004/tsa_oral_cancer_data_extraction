The patient was a 60-year-old male diagnosed with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, initially identified on March 27, 2012. The tumor was staged as T4a, indicating an aggressive local invasion with substantial involvement of the tongue. Following surgical resection involving a selective neck dissection (1-4), the patient was deemed to have no nodal involvement (N0). Adjuvant therapy was subsequently administered. Despite these measures, the patient ultimately succumbed to other causes on December 29, 2016, representing a poor prognosis given the initial aggressive tumor stage and the ultimate lack of response to treatment.
