This patient is a 67-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the hard palate, diagnosed on March 1st, 2016. The initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to the potential for regional lymph node involvement. Pathological examination revealed a T4a tumor and clinically significant nodal disease, specifically N2c nodal involvement according to the 8th edition staging system, along with N3b disease. The patient underwent adjuvant therapy, although the specifics are not detailed in this summary. Follow-up was conducted on April 27th, 2018, at which time the disease was determined to be progressed and metastatic, with the patient ultimately dying with disease. This case represents a significant challenge due to the advanced stage of the tumor at initial diagnosis and its dissemination to multiple levels of the neck.
