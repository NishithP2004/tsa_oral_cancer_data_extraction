This patient is a 59-year-old male who presented with a floor of mouth oral squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed on September 1st, 2016. The initial pathology revealed a moderately differentiated tumor, classified as T4a according to the 8th edition clinical tumor staging system. Following initial surgery involving a selective neck dissection (1-4 levels), the patient underwent adjuvant therapy, which was not specified. Despite initial surgical resection, the cancer recurred on May 25th, 2019. Importantly, pathological examination at the time of recurrence demonstrated no nodal involvement (N0), indicating a pathological N0 stage. The last follow-up was also May 25th, 2019, and the patient remains alive while under surveillance with disease present at the floor of mouth. This case represents a significant challenge due to local recurrence following initial treatment, and ongoing monitoring is crucial.
