The patient is a 62-year-old male who underwent surgery on May 15, 2020, for a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. The initial surgical approach involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Subsequent pathological examination revealed a T2, N0 staging, consistent with the 8th Edition clinical tumor staging system. Importantly, the pathological nodal examination revealed no evidence of nodal involvement (N0). Despite this favorable nodal status, the tumor was classified as moderately differentiated and presented as a T3 lesion. A final follow-up examination on June 2, 2021, indicated no evidence of disease. While the initial surgical and nodal staging was favorable, ongoing surveillance is crucial to monitor for any potential recurrence.
