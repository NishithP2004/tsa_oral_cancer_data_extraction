This 48-year-old male patient presented with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located in the buccal mucosa. The tumor was initially diagnosed and surgically removed on January 15, 2020, utilizing a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to the location. Pathological examination revealed a T2 stage, indicating a tumor size greater than 2 centimeters and/or with local invasion, and an N0 stage, signifying no regional lymph node involvement. Following the surgery, adjuvant therapy was not administered. At the last follow-up on December 12, 2020, there was no evidence of disease, suggesting an excellent response to the initial surgical treatment.
