This patient is a 34-year-old female presenting with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, initially diagnosed and surgically treated on November 26, 2020. The tumor was staged clinically as T4a, indicating a large tumor with potential invasion into deeper tissues and/or adjacent structures. Subsequent pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis and revealed an N2b nodal staging, indicating the presence of metastasis to level II/III lymph nodes. The selective neck dissection performed at the time of surgery was successful. Following surgery and adjuvant therapy (details not specified), the patient remained free of evidence of disease at her last follow-up on September 10, 2021.
