This 52-year-old male patient presented with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma originating on the tongue. The tumor was initially diagnosed and surgically removed on 2/27/2018. The initial surgery involved a selective neck dissection, indicating involvement of regional lymph nodes. Subsequent pathological examination revealed the tumor to be clinically staged as T3 and pathologically staged as N2c and N3b, representing significant regional lymph node metastasis. The patient subsequently received adjuvant therapy following the surgery. Unfortunately, despite these measures, the patient succumbed to the disease with disease progression. The last documented follow-up was on 12/9/2018.
