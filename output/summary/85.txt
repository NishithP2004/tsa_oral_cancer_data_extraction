The patient is a 73-year-old male who underwent surgery on December 2nd, 2013, for a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located in the retromolar trigone. The initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Pathological staging according to the 8th Edition revealed a T4a tumor, indicating extensive local invasion, and an N0 nodal status, signifying no detectable involvement of regional lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis. Given the T4a classification, adjuvant therapy was initiated. Following the surgery and adjuvant treatment, there was no evidence of disease detected at the last follow-up on January 8th, 2014.
