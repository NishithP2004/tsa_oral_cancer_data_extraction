The patient is a 68-year-old male who underwent surgery on December 19, 2017, for a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located in the alveolus of the oral cavity. The initial surgical approach involved a selective neck dissection, with lymph nodes 1-4 removed. Pathology revealed a T4a tumor staging, indicating extensive local invasion. Subsequent pathological examination of the lymph nodes yielded an N0 staging, indicating no regional lymph node involvement at the time of the initial resection. Despite this initial favorable nodal assessment, the patientâ€™s condition progressed, and he was last seen on May 19, 2020, with the disease. Sadly, he died with disease, indicating the carcinoma had metastasized beyond the initial surgical site and lymph nodes, likely leading to a final N2c staging given the later follow-up and clinical presentation.
