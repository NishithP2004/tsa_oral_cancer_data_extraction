This patient is a 55-year-old male who underwent surgery on March 13, 2018, for a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the floor of mouth. The initial surgical procedure involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4), indicating concerns about potential lymph node involvement. Pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a T1 stage tumor with no nodal involvement (N0). Given the initial staging, adjuvant therapy was not administered. The last follow-up, conducted on December 7, 2020, reported no evidence of disease. This represents a favorable clinical outcome following initial surgical management.
