The patient is a 54-year-old male who underwent surgery on March 5, 2012, for a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located in the buccal mucosa. The initial surgical approach involved a modified radical neck dissection, indicating a concern for potential metastasis. Pathology revealed a T3 tumor, signifying a larger tumor size, and a subsequent pathological N0 staging, suggesting no detectable nodal involvement at the time of the initial surgery. Despite this seemingly favorable N0 staging, adjuvant therapy was administered. A follow-up examination on January 9, 2013, reported no evidence of disease. However, given the initial T3 classification and the procedure of a modified radical neck dissection, continued surveillance is warranted to ensure long-term disease-free status.
