This patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent surgery on April 23, 2020, for a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located in the buccal mucosa. The initial surgical approach involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns regarding potential nodal involvement. Pathological examination confirmed a T2 tumor based on the 8th edition staging system and revealed no nodal involvement (N0) according to the same staging system. The tumor was well-differentiated. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. The last follow-up was conducted on October 1, 2020, and at that time, there was no evidence of disease. Importantly, the initial surgical specimen demonstrated N1 nodal involvement, which was subsequently re-evaluated and found to be N0 upon pathological review, indicating an initial misinterpretation of the surgical findings.
