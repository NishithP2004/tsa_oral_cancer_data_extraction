This 63-year-old male patient presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on January 27, 2015. The initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection, removing lymph nodes 1 through 4. Subsequent pathological examination revealed the tumor to be clinically staged as T4a and pathologically staged as N3b, indicating extensive local invasion and regional lymph node involvement. The patient subsequently underwent adjuvant therapy. At the last follow-up on May 1, 2022, there was no evidence of disease, although the original tumor was surgically removed with subsequent lymph node dissection revealing significant nodal involvement.
