This 72-year-old male patient presented with a floor of mouth oral squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed on October 7, 2015. The tumor was classified as moderately differentiated and was staged clinically as T4a, indicating an aggressive local extent. Due to the presence of metastasis to regional lymph nodes (N1), a selective neck dissection was performed. Pathological examination revealed an N0 nodal stage, suggesting no initial nodal involvement beyond the initially dissected tissue. Despite this initial finding, the patient progressed to disease with metastatic involvement, as confirmed by the last follow-up on October 20, 2015. The patient ultimately succumbed to the disease. The clinical and pathological findings align with a significant, locally advanced oral cancer requiring extensive surgical intervention, but ultimately unsuccessful in achieving long-term control.‚Äù} </body>
