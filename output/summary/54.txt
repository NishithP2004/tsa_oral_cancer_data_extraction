The patient is a 27-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on September 13, 2011. Initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection, with the initial pathology indicating a T4a and N1 staging according to the 8th edition of the Clinical Tumor Staging system. Following this, the patient experienced nodal recurrence on January 11, 2012, leading to a laterality-specific bilateral neck dissection and a confirmed pathological N3b staging. Despite adjuvant therapy, the disease progressed, culminating in his death with disease on June 20, 2012. The final pathological findings confirmed a T4a tumor stage.
