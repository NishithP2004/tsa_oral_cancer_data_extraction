The patient is a 31-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on 6/28/2018. The initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to suspicion of nodal involvement. Pathological examination revealed the tumor to be T4a, indicating a large tumor with potential for perineural invasion, and confirmed N2b and N3b nodal involvement according to the 8th Edition staging system. This signifies that the cancer had spread to regional lymph nodes. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was not administered. A final follow-up examination conducted on 12/15/2018 indicated no evidence of disease. Despite the aggressive nature of the initial diagnosis and significant nodal involvement, the patientâ€™s last follow-up demonstrated successful treatment and a lack of recurrence at that time.
