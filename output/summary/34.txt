This patient is a 67-year-old male who underwent surgery on March 20, 2012, for a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. The initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection, with levels 1 through 4 examined. Subsequent adjuvant therapy was initiated. Pathological staging, according to the 8th Edition, revealed a T4a tumor – indicating a large tumor with potential for invasion – and a T3 classification, signifying a tumor extending into deeper tissues. Critically, the pathological nodal examination demonstrated no involvement of regional lymph nodes (N0). Last follow-up on March 8, 2021, reported no evidence of disease. This represents a favorable outcome following treatment, although continued surveillance is always warranted for any head and neck cancer.
