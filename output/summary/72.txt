The patient is a 63-year-old male diagnosed with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, initially identified on 10/28/2014. The tumor was staged clinically as T4a and surgically treated with a selective neck dissection (1-4 levels). Pathological examination revealed a T3 tumor and clinically negative N1 nodal status at the time of surgery, classified according to the 8th Edition staging system. Subsequent pathological review confirmed N0 nodal involvement. The patient was last followed up on 5/5/2021, reporting no evidence of disease. This suggests a successful initial surgical resection and adjuvant treatment were not required, given the absence of nodal involvement at the time of diagnosis and the lack of disease recurrence during follow-up.
