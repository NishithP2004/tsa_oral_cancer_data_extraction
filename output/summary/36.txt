This patient is a 53-year-old female who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa. The tumor was initially diagnosed on 4/20/2017 and was classified as T4a, indicating a large tumor with potential for invasion into deeper structures. Due to the extent of the tumor, a selective neck dissection was performed (levels 1-4). Pathological examination revealed no nodal involvement at the N0 stage. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was not administered. The last follow-up, conducted on 11/20/2017, reported no evidence of disease. Despite the initial T4a staging, the final follow-up demonstrated complete resolution of the cancer, indicating successful treatment and no recurrence at that time.
