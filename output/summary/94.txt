The patient is a 42-year-old male who underwent surgery on March 22, 2012, for a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. The initial surgical approach involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Pathology revealed a T3 lesion (extending into the underlying muscle) and an N2b nodal status, indicating metastasis to the neck. Following the surgery and adjuvant therapy (details not provided in this summary), the patient was last followed up on June 20, 2012, with no evidence of disease. This initial treatment response, combined with the relatively early age of diagnosis, suggests a potentially favorable outcome at the time of follow-up.
