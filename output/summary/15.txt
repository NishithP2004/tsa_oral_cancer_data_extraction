This 60-year-old female patient was diagnosed with well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa in July 2013. The initial tumor was classified as T4a, indicating extensive local invasion. Following surgical resection involving a selective neck dissection (1-4 levels), the patient was staged as N0, indicating no regional lymph node involvement. The patient subsequently received adjuvant therapy. At the last follow-up on March 11, 2014, there was no evidence of disease. The surgical procedure targeted the buccal mucosa, and the complete node status at the time of surgery was negative.
