This patient is a 70-year-old female who presented with an oral cancer originating in the tongue. The diagnosis of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma was established following surgery on October 24, 2017. The initial surgical approach involved a selective neck dissection (1-4 levels), indicating concern for regional lymph node involvement. Pathological examination revealed a T4a staging, indicating a large primary tumor, and confirmed N2b and N3b nodal involvement, signifying significant spread within the neck. Adjuvant therapy was initiated. Unfortunately, despite these interventions, the patient succumbed to other causes following a last follow-up on July 13, 2018. The case represents a complex and aggressive presentation of oral squamous cell carcinoma with extensive regional nodal disease.
