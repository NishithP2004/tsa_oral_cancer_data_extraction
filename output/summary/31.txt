This 42-year-old female patient presented with a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed following surgical resection performed on November 9, 2016. The initial surgical procedure involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Subsequent pathological examination revealed a T3 tumor, indicating extensive invasion, and an N0 nodal status, signifying no detectable lymph node involvement at the time of diagnosis. The patient subsequently received adjuvant therapy. At the last follow-up on May 6, 2022, there was no evidence of disease recurrence. The tumor was located within the tongue subsite. Based on the 8th edition clinical tumor staging, the initial stage was T2.
