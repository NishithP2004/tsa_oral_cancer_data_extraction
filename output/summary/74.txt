This 68-year-old female patient presented with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located in the alveolus of the mouth. The initial surgical intervention, performed on February 19, 2013, involved a selective neck dissection with involvement of levels 1-4. Subsequent pathological examination revealed a T4a tumor staging, indicating extensive local invasion. Despite a negative pathological N0 staging (indicating no regional lymph node involvement at the time of initial biopsy), the overall clinical stage was significant due to the T4a classification. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was not administered. The patient was last followed up on January 17, 2022, with no evidence of disease. However, given the initial T4a staging and the surgical extent of the procedure, continued vigilance and long-term follow-up are warranted to monitor for potential recurrence.
