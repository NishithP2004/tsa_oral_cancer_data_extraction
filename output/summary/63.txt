This 57-year-old female patient presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on 11/11/2018. The initial tumor was classified as T2, indicating a locally advanced tumor. Due to the bilateral involvement of lymph nodes (N2c), a selective neck dissection was performed. Pathologically, the regional lymph nodes showed no evidence of metastasis (N0). Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. At the last follow-up on 3/3/2021, there was no evidence of disease recurrence. The clinical staging according to the 8th Edition is therefore T2 N2c. â€œ
