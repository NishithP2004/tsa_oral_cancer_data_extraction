This 57-year-old female patient presented with oral cancer, diagnosed through a selective neck dissection performed on August 7, 2018, following the identification of a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. Pathological examination revealed a T3 tumor, indicating significant local invasion, and a clinically negative N0 nodal status at the time of surgery. The surgery was performed to assess for regional spread, and the lack of palpable nodal involvement was noted. Following the surgery, adjuvant therapy was not administered. A final follow-up assessment on October 17, 2018, indicated no evidence of disease. This suggests an initial successful surgical resection with no recurrence detected within the immediate post-operative period.
