The patient is a 54-year-old male who underwent a modified radical neck dissection and surgical resection of a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue on August 11, 2020. Pathology revealed a T4a tumor stage, indicating extensive local invasion. Critically, the surgical findings also demonstrated N2a and N3b nodal involvement, signifying metastasis to regional lymph nodes. Following the initial surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. At the last follow-up on March 5, 2021, there was no evidence of disease, indicating successful treatment and long-term remission. This case demonstrates a challenging initial presentation of oral squamous cell carcinoma with significant regional spread, successfully managed through aggressive surgical intervention and subsequent monitoring.
