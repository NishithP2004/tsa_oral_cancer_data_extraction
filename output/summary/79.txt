This patient is a 48-year-old male who underwent surgery on April 18, 2013, for a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. The initial surgical procedure involved a selective neck dissection, with no identified lymph node involvement (N0). Pathology revealed a T3 tumor, indicating a larger tumor size extending into deeper tissues. Following the surgery, adjuvant therapy was not administered. The last follow-up was conducted on August 18, 2014. Unfortunately, the patient ultimately succumbed to other causes. While the initial tumor was classified as T3, and the nodal status was negative, the long-term outcome indicates a challenging course with eventual death, highlighting the potential for recurrence or progression in oral squamous cell carcinomas despite standard surgical management and initial negative nodal findings.
