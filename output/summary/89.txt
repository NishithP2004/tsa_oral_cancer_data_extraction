This patient is a 60-year-old female who underwent selective neck dissection on November 5th, 2012, following the diagnosis of moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. The initial tumor was classified as T3, indicating extensive involvement. Pathological examination revealed no nodal involvement (N0), aligning with the 8th edition staging criteria. Following surgical resection, a final follow-up on January 3rd, 2013, reported no evidence of disease. This suggests an initial successful surgical intervention and complete pathological clearance at the time of the last documented follow-up.
