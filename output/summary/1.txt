This 40-year-old male patient presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa. The tumor was initially diagnosed and surgically removed on June 21, 2018, with a radical neck dissection performed due to the advanced stage of the disease, indicated by a T4a staging and N3b nodal involvement. The N3b status reflects extensive metastasis to the neck nodes. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was not administered. Unfortunately, despite these measures, the patient succumbed to the disease with disease progression, confirmed at the last follow-up on August 27, 2018. This case represents a significant challenge due to the aggressive nature of the tumor and the widespread dissemination of the disease as evidenced by the N3b nodal status.
