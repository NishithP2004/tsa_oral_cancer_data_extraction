This 56-year-old male patient presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa, diagnosed on 10/10/2018. Initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection (1-4 levels) due to suspicion of nodal involvement. The tumor was staged as T4a, indicating a large primary tumor, and N2b, signifying involvement of level II and III lymph nodes. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. Subsequent pathological examination confirmed the N2a staging, reflecting the involvement of level II and III lymph nodes. At the last follow-up on 9/1/2021, there was no evidence of disease recurrence. The case demonstrates a challenging presentation of oral squamous cell carcinoma requiring aggressive surgical and adjuvant management, ultimately resulting in sustained disease-free status.
