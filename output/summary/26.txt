This patient is a 28-year-old male who presented with a floor of mouth oral squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed on July 16, 2015. The tumor was classified as moderately differentiated and was staged clinically as T4a, indicating an aggressive local extent. Following initial surgical resection involving selective neck dissection (levels 1-4), the patient underwent adjuvant therapy. Unfortunately, the cancer recurred on August 29, 2018. Pathological examination at the time of recurrence revealed an N0 nodal status, signifying no detectable spread to nearby lymph nodes. Despite this, the disease progressed. The patient's last follow-up was January 1, 2019, at which point he was unfortunately reported to be ‘died with disease,’ indicating the cancer was not controlled despite treatment and surveillance. This case highlights the significant challenge of managing locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma and underscores the potential for recurrence even with seemingly complete initial resection and N0 nodal status.
