This patient is a 35-year-old male who was diagnosed with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue in July 2015. The tumor was initially classified as T4a, indicating a large tumor with invasive potential, and N0, signifying no detectable regional lymph node involvement at the time of initial diagnosis. Following surgical resection involving a selective neck dissection (with involvement of bilateral nodes), the patient underwent adjuvant therapy. A follow-up on November 2, 2019, revealed no evidence of disease. The initial surgical procedure, combined with adjuvant therapy, appears to have been successful in achieving complete pathological remission.
