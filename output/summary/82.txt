The patient is a 34-year-old male who underwent surgery on July 9, 2013, for a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. The initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of T2 stage disease, indicating a tumor size greater than 2 cm or with local extension. Critically, the pathology revealed no evidence of nodal involvement (N0). Following surgery, the patient did not receive adjuvant therapy. The last follow-up, conducted on March 22, 2014, reported no evidence of disease. This represents a favorable outcome following treatment, with no recurrence detected at that time.
