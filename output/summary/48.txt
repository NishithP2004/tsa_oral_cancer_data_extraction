This patient is a 53-year-old female who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on March 1st, 2016. The tumor was classified as T4a, indicating a large and invasive lesion. Initial surgical management involved a selective neck dissection, with the neck dissection revealing no nodal involvement (N0). Subsequently, a bilateral neck dissection was performed, confirming N2b nodal status, likely reflecting a more widespread disease process. Following the initial surgery, adjuvant therapy was not administered. Last follow-up on October 11th, 2016 reported no evidence of disease. The case represents a challenging presentation of oral squamous cell carcinoma with significant local invasion and associated nodal involvement, although ultimately, at the time of last follow-up, the patient was disease-free.
