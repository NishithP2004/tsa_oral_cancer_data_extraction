This patient is a 60-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on October 27, 2016. The tumor was classified as T4a, indicating an extensive local invasion, and involved regional lymph nodes, classified as N2c, signifying a significant nodal involvement. Consequently, a selective neck dissection was performed. Following the initial surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. At the last follow-up on April 28, 2022, there was no evidence of disease. The pathology reports consistently confirmed the N2c nodal staging and the T4a tumor classification. Importantly, the patient remains disease-free at the time of last follow-up.
