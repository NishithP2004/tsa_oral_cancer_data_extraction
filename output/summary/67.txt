This 55-year-old male patient presented with an oral cancer diagnosed on 6/18/2018, originating in the subsite of the tongue. The tumor was classified as a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Following initial surgical resection involving a selective neck dissection (1-4 levels), a pathological examination revealed a T2 stage and N1 nodal involvement. Importantly, despite the N1 status, pathological staging according to the 8th edition indicated N0, suggesting a clinically negative neck dissection. Last follow-up on 12/1/2020 revealed no evidence of disease. This suggests an initial successful treatment response with adjuvant therapy not specified in the provided notes, leading to no detectable recurrence at the last documented assessment.
