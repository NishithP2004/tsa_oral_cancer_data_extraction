This patient is a 60-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on January 19, 2017. The tumor was initially classified as T3 with N2c staging, indicating a larger primary tumor and involvement of the neck nodes with extension. Following radical neck dissection, the pathological findings revealed an N2b nodal status, confirming further spread. Subsequently, adjuvant therapy was initiated. Despite these interventions, the patient progressed and was last seen with disease on November 9, 2017, with a final T4a classification, reflecting extensive disease involvement, including the tongue. Unfortunately, the patient ultimately succumbed to his disease.
