This 68-year-old male patient presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the alveolus, initially diagnosed in December 2012. The tumor was staged clinically as T4a, indicating an aggressive local invasion. Following initial surgery involving selective neck dissection (with involvement of 1-4 lymph nodes), the patient experienced local recurrence on June 6th, 2013, and subsequent nodal recurrence on the same date. Adjuvant therapy was administered. Pathological examination confirmed a final N3b nodal staging, indicating extensive spread. Despite treatment, the patient ultimately succumbed to the disease with disease progression. Last follow-up was June 6th, 2014.
