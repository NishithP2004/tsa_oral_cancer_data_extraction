This 45-year-old female patient presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on February 13, 2020. The tumor was staged clinically as T4a, indicating a large primary tumor with extension, and was confirmed pathologically. Due to the extent of the tumor, a selective neck dissection was performed. Pathological examination revealed the tumor to be moderately differentiated and, critically, demonstrated N3b nodal involvement â€“ indicating metastasis to the neck nodes. Despite the advanced stage, the patient remained disease-free at her last follow-up on March 28, 2020. The final pathological staging confirmed the initial clinical assessment.
