This 53-year-old male patient presented with a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on February 24, 2015. The initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection, with a subsequent pathological examination revealing an aggressive tumor classified as T4a (extensive local invasion) and N3b (metastatic disease involving multiple ipsilateral and contralateral lymph nodes). This indicated a clinically significant stage 4 disease according to the 8th Edition staging system. Following the initial surgery and confirmed N3b nodal status, adjuvant therapy was initiated. Unfortunately, despite these interventions, the patient ultimately succumbed to the disease, with the final follow-up documented on November 25, 2015, confirming the presence of metastatic disease. The bilateral neck dissection was performed.
