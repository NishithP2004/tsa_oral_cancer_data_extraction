This 42-year-old male patient presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on June 13, 2019. The tumor was initially staged as T4a and N2b according to the 8th Edition Clinical Tumor Staging system, indicating extensive local involvement and regional lymph node metastasis. Following initial surgical resection including a selective neck dissection, the patient underwent adjuvant therapy. Despite this, the tumor recurred locally on May 8, 2020. Subsequent follow-up on the same date revealed the patient was unfortunately dying with disease. Importantly, pathological examination at the time of recurrence demonstrated an N0 status, indicating no nodal involvement at the initial surgical resection, suggesting potential issues with initial staging or subsequent disease progression. The final follow-up date, May 8, 2020, marked the patient's demise due to the metastatic disease.
