This 63-year-old male patient presented with a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the retromolar trigone, diagnosed following radical neck dissection and surgery performed on May 6th, 2014. The initial pathological staging, according to the 8th Edition, indicated a T4a tumor and N1 nodal involvement. Importantly, pathological N staging was reported as N0, suggesting an initial discrepancy in the nodal assessment that required further investigation. Adjuvant therapy was administered. Last follow-up, conducted on June 6th, 2014, revealed no evidence of disease. The case highlights the aggressive nature of the tumor and the need for meticulous surgical and pathological evaluation, including careful consideration of nodal status.
