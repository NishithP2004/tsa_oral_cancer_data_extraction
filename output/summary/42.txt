This patient is a 48-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa. The initial diagnosis, confirmed via surgical biopsy on 2/2/2017, revealed a T4a tumor, indicating extensive local invasion. Due to the extent of the tumor and involvement of regional lymph nodes, a selective neck dissection was performed. Pathological examination subsequently confirmed the presence of N2b nodal involvement. Following surgery and adjuvant therapy (details not specified), the patientâ€™s condition progressed, ultimately leading to his death with disease. The last documented follow-up was on 6/16/2017. The tumor's aggressive nature, as indicated by the T4a staging, contributed to the poor prognosis and disease progression.
