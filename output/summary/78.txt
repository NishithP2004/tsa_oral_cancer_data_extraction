This 79-year-old male patient presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed following surgical resection on November 18, 2018. The initial pathology revealed a T3 tumor, indicating extensive local invasion. Due to concerns about potential metastasis, a selective neck dissection was performed. Pathological examination revealed nodal involvement (N1), further supporting the need for adjuvant therapy, which was initiated. Subsequent follow-up on June 25, 2019, indicated no evidence of disease. The case highlights a complex presentation of oral cancer with initial local invasion and subsequent nodal spread, successfully managed with surgical intervention and adjuvant treatment, culminating in an absence of disease at the last documented follow-up.
