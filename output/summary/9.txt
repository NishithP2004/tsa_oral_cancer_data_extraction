This patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent surgery on June 2nd, 2011, for a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located in the buccal mucosa. The initial surgical approach involved a modified radical neck dissection, performed due to the T4a staging indicating extensive local invasion. Pathological examination revealed nodal involvement, classified as N2b according to the 8th edition staging system. Despite the aggressive nature of the tumor and the presence of N2 nodal disease, the patient was last followed up on September 17th, 2011, and at that time, there was no evidence of disease. This suggests a successful initial treatment response and complete pathological clearance at the time of follow-up.
