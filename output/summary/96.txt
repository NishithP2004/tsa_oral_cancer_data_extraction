This 76-year-old male patient presented with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma originating in the alveolus of his lower lip. The tumor was diagnosed on April 16, 2020, and was classified as T4a, indicating a large tumor with extension beyond the oral cavity. Due to the concern for metastasis, a selective neck dissection was performed (levels 1-4). Pathological examination revealed the cancer had spread to two levels of lymph nodes (N2a staging), necessitating adjuvant therapy. Following surgery and adjuvant treatment, there was no evidence of disease detected at the last follow-up on July 24, 2020.
