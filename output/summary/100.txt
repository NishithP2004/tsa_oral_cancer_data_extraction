The patient is a 60-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, initially diagnosed and surgically treated on July 4th, 2016. The tumor was classified as T4b, indicating a large tumor with extension, and staged according to the 8th Edition clinical tumor staging system. A selective neck dissection was performed, with no positive lymph nodes identified (N2a). Following initial surgery, the patient experienced local recurrence on October 1st, 2016. Despite this recurrence, no further adjuvant therapy was administered. Sadly, the patient ultimately succumbed to the disease with disease progression, and his last follow-up was documented on November 23rd, 2016.
