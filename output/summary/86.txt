The patient is a 43-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on February 11, 2021. The initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to suspicion of nodal involvement. Pathological examination revealed a T2 tumor (size and local extent) and a clinically N1 nodal status, indicating metastasis to regional lymph nodes. Following the initial surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. The most recent follow-up on May 20, 2022, reported no evidence of disease. This indicates successful management and treatment of the oral cancer, with the tumor originating on the tongue.
