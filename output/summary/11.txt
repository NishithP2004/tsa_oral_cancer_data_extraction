This 55-year-old male patient presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the retromolar trigone, diagnosed on April 23, 2020. The initial surgical intervention involved a modified radical neck dissection, followed by adjuvant therapy, as indicated by the T4a staging. Pathological examination revealed nodal involvement, classified as N3b, confirming the aggressive nature of the disease. Despite the initial surgical procedure, the patient experienced local recurrence on September 30, 2020. Subsequent follow-up on October 18, 2020, indicated continued disease progression. Sadly, the patient ultimately succumbed to the disease while still under observation with disease progression. The initial tumor staging according to the 8th edition was T4a, reflecting a significant extent of tumor involvement at the time of initial diagnosis.
