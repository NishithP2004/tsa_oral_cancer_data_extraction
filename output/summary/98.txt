This patient, a 56-year-old female, presented with a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma originating in the buccal mucosa. The initial surgical resection, performed on June 4th, 2013, involved selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) following clinical tumor staging according to the 8th Edition, classifying the primary tumor as T2. Despite this, the patient experienced a local recurrence on August 12th, 2013. Subsequent pathological examination revealed an N3b nodal status, indicating spread to the neck nodes, and a T4a classification, signifying a larger tumor with potential involvement of adjacent structures. Adjuvant therapy was administered. Unfortunately, the patient ultimately succumbed to the disease, with the final follow-up documented on September 16th, 2013. This case represents a challenging scenario of oral squamous cell carcinoma, characterized by initial T2 staging, local recurrence, and a significant Nodal staging of N3b, ultimately leading to progression and death with disease.
