The patient is a 35-year-old male who underwent surgery on February 18, 2021, for a diagnosis of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. The initial surgical procedure involved a selective neck dissection, indicating involvement of regional lymph nodes. Pathology confirmed a T3 stage, indicating a larger primary tumor, and N2b nodal staging, signifying the presence of metastasis to level II or III lymph nodes. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. At the last follow-up on August 17, 2021, the patient remained alive but was identified as having disease progression. The surgical site was the tongue, consistent with the initial diagnosis. This progression to disease status, combined with the initial T3 and N2b staging, suggests a significant challenge in managing this case, likely requiring continued monitoring and consideration of additional therapeutic options.
