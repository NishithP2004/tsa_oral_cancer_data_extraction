This patient is a 27-year-old female who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on October 18, 2016. The initial tumor was classified as T4a, indicating extensive local invasion and involvement. Due to the N2c nodal staging, indicating metastasis to the neck, a selective neck dissection was performed. Subsequent pathological examination confirmed the N2c nodal involvement. Given the aggressive nature of the disease and the extent of local and nodal involvement, adjuvant therapy was not administered. The last follow-up on March 20, 2017, revealed no evidence of disease. Despite the initial concerning findings and surgical intervention, the patient achieved complete remission at the time of last follow-up.
