This 46-year-old male presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on October 27, 2015. The tumor was classified as T3, indicating extension beyond the tongue itself, and N0, indicating no detectable regional lymph node involvement. Following surgical resection involving a selective neck dissection, the patient underwent adjuvant therapy. A final follow-up on June 18, 2016, revealed no evidence of disease. The initial surgery involved bilateral dissection, consistent with a T3 staging. Importantly, the absence of nodal involvement was a positive prognostic indicator. At the time of last follow-up, there was no recurrence or evidence of metastasis.
