This patient is a 78-year-old male who underwent surgery on February 17, 2011, for a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. The initial surgical procedure involved a selective neck dissection, with levels 1-4 examined. Pathology revealed a T1 primary tumor. Nodal status at the time of surgery was N2a, indicating the involvement of the regional lymph nodes. Importantly, a follow-up examination on April 2, 2011, reported no evidence of disease. This suggests that at the time of last follow-up, the patient was considered free of disease, despite the initial diagnosis of a clinically significant oral cancer with regional lymph node involvement.
