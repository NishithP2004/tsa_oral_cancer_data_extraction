This patient is a 45-year-old female presenting with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on December 18, 2018. The initial surgical intervention involved a modified radical neck dissection, performed to address the tumor's proximity to the lymph nodes. Pathological examination revealed a T1 primary tumor and a clinically N2b nodal status, however, surprisingly, the pathological examination of the neck nodes revealed no evidence of cancer (N0). Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was not administered. The last follow-up was conducted on October 25, 2021, and reported no evidence of disease. This represents a positive outcome, with the patient remaining disease-free at the time of last contact.
