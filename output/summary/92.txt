This 83-year-old male patient presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma originating in the buccal mucosa. The tumor was diagnosed on November 9, 2015, and was classified as T4a, indicating a large tumor with potential for local invasion and involvement of surrounding tissues. Due to this, a selective neck dissection was performed. Pathological examination revealed no palpable nodal involvement (N0). Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was not administered. Despite these findings, the patient ultimately succumbed to other causes following a last follow-up on January 9, 2016. This case represents a challenging presentation of oral squamous cell carcinoma with significant local extent, highlighting the importance of complete surgical resection and close monitoring for recurrence.
