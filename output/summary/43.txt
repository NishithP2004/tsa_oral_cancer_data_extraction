This 52-year-old male presented with a verrucous carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on April 13, 2020. Initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns regarding potential nodal involvement. Subsequent pathological examination revealed an aggressive tumor with a clinical staging of T3 and a pathological staging of T4a, alongside a pathological N staging of N3b, indicating extensive nodal spread. Adjuvant therapy was administered. Despite treatment, the patient ultimately succumbed to other causes following a last follow-up on August 24, 2020. The bilateral neck dissection and the aggressive nature of the verrucous carcinoma were significant factors in the patient's unfortunately fatal outcome.
