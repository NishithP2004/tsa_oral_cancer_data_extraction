The patient is a 43-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. Surgical resection with selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) was performed on 12/1/2014. Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of a T4a tumor, indicating extensive local invasion, and revealed nodal involvement classified as N2b and N3b according to the 8th edition staging system, signifying spread to the neck. Adjuvant therapy was not administered. Following the initial surgery, a final follow-up on 6/1/2015 reported no evidence of disease. This represents a successful outcome, with complete surgical resection and subsequent absence of detectable disease at the time of last follow-up.
