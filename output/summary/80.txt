The patient is a 67-year-old female diagnosed with well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, initially identified on 4/30/2013. The tumor was surgically removed with a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) performed at the same time. Pathological examination revealed a T2 stage tumor, indicating a moderate size, and importantly, no nodal involvement (N0). Following the initial surgery, the patient underwent no adjuvant therapy. The last follow-up date was 12/30/2013, at which time there was no evidence of disease. The tumor was located on the tongue. Based on this information, the patientâ€™s oral cancer was initially treated with surgery, and subsequent follow-up indicated successful disease control with no evidence of recurrence at the time of the final assessment.
