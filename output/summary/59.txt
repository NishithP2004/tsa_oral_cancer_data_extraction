This 53-year-old male patient presented with a floor of mouth oral squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed on 8/6/2018. The tumor was classified as moderately differentiated and exhibited an invasive growth pattern consistent with a T2 staging. Due to the involvement of regional lymph nodes – specifically N2b nodal disease – a selective neck dissection was performed. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. At the last follow-up on 1/30/2020, the patient remained alive but with evidence of disease, confirming the N2b pathological nodal stage. This indicates a persistent, but not necessarily advanced, metastatic disease process involving regional lymph nodes.
