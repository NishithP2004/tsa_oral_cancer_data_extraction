The patient is a 55-year-old male who underwent surgery for moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the lips on December 3rd, 2013. The initial tumor was classified as T4a, indicating extensive local invasion, and was treated with a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Subsequent pathological examination revealed no nodal involvement (N0) despite the T4a staging, suggesting the primary tumor may have been confined to the lip tissue. Adjuvant therapy was administered. The final follow-up on September 28th, 2015, reported no evidence of disease. The bilateral neck dissection performed aligns with the T4a staging, indicating a significant initial tumor burden. While the final follow-up is positive for no evidence of disease, the patient's initial staging and surgical intervention reflect a substantial oral cancer case.
