This 48-year-old female patient presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on November 16, 2015. The tumor was classified as T3 with a laterality of bilateral, indicating an initial extent of invasion. A modified radical neck dissection was performed. Subsequent pathological examination revealed a nodal involvement of N1 and N2a, confirming the spread of the cancer to regional lymph nodes. Given the T4a stage and nodal status, adjuvant therapy was initiated. Despite the aggressive nature of the initial diagnosis, the patient was last followed up on February 2, 2019, reporting no evidence of disease. This represents a successful outcome following aggressive treatment and ongoing surveillance.
