This patient is a 40-year-old male who was diagnosed with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, identified through surgical resection on May 17, 2011. The initial pathology revealed a T3 tumor stage, indicating a larger tumor with potential regional extension. Following surgical removal, a selective neck dissection was performed, with no evidence of lymph node involvement (N0). The patient subsequently received adjuvant therapy. At the last follow-up on June 24, 2019, there was no evidence of disease recurrence. This represents a favorable outcome following treatment for his oral cancer.
