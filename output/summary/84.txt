The patient is a 47-year-old male who underwent surgery for a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue on May 20, 2016. The initial surgical approach involved a selective neck dissection, with lymph nodes 1-4 removed. Pathology revealed a T2, N3b tumor. Despite the N3b staging, subsequent follow-up on December 7, 2016, indicated no evidence of disease. This suggests an initial aggressive presentation with regional lymph node involvement, but successful management with surgical intervention and subsequent surveillance.
