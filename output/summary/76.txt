The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent surgery on 11/22/2016 for a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma arising from the buccal mucosa. The initial tumor was classified as T4a, indicating a large tumor with extension into deeper tissues. Following surgical resection, a selective neck dissection was performed, with no nodal involvement identified (N0). However, pathological examination revealed N1 nodal involvement, requiring additional treatment. The patient subsequently received adjuvant therapy. At the last follow-up on 8/3/2017, there was no evidence of disease recurrence.
