This patient is a 60-year-old male who presented with oral cancer originating on the tongue. The initial surgery, performed on October 15, 2012, revealed a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The surgical approach was a modified radical neck dissection, and subsequent adjuvant therapy was initiated. Following the initial surgery, the patient experienced local recurrence on July 19, 2013, indicating metastatic nodal disease. A subsequent pathological examination revealed an N3b nodal stage, confirming the spread of the tumor to the neck lymph nodes. The final pathological staging was T2N3b. Despite the initial surgical intervention and adjuvant therapy, the patient's disease progressed, highlighting the aggressive nature of this type of oral cancer. The last documented follow-up is currently undefined, suggesting an uncertain status at the time of reporting.
