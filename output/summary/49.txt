This patient is a 48-year-old female diagnosed with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, initially identified on January 4th, 2021. The tumor was surgically removed with a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns regarding regional lymph node involvement. Post-operative pathology revealed a T2 tumor with N0 nodal status, indicating no detectable cancer cells in the initially examined neck lymph nodes. Despite this favorable initial pathology, the tumor was classified as T3, signifying an invasive growth. Subsequent follow-up on August 12th, 2021, demonstrated no evidence of disease. However, the initial staging as T3 necessitates continued surveillance, given the potential for residual or distant disease. The bilateral nodal staging was classified as N2b, indicating a higher risk of nodal involvement despite the initial N0 findings, warranting continued vigilance.
