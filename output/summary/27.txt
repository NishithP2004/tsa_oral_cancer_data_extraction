This patient is a 40-year-old female who presented with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma arising from the buccal mucosa. The initial surgery, performed on 2/1/2011, involved a selective neck dissection, revealing no clinically detectable nodal involvement (N0). However, the tumor subsequently recurred on 3/23/2011, demonstrating a local recurrence. The initial pathological staging was T4a, indicating a large tumor with potential for invasion into deeper tissues and/or involvement of adjacent structures. Following recurrence, a pathological N3b staging was assigned, signifying extensive nodal involvement, likely due to the aggressive nature of the disease. Despite the initial surgical resection and subsequent adjuvant therapy (which is not specified in this summary), the patient ultimately succumbed to the disease. The last documented follow-up was on 8/3/2014.
