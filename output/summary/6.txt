The patient is a 58-year-old male who presented with a floor of mouth oral squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed on 3/24/2017. Initial surgical management involved a modified radical neck dissection, followed by adjuvant therapy. Pathology revealed a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Despite this, the patient experienced local recurrence on 2/15/2021. Subsequent examination on the same date confirmed metastatic disease with a pathological N3b nodal staging, indicating extensive nodal involvement. The initial tumor was classified as T4a, suggesting a large primary tumor. This case represents a challenging scenario of a recurrent oral cancer with significant nodal metastasis, despite initial surgical resection. The patient's current status, as of the last follow-up on 2/15/2021, is alive with disease.
