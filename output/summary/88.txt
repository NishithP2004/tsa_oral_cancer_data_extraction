This patient is a 60-year-old male who underwent surgery on 10/22/2012 for a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. The initial surgical procedure involved a selective neck dissection (1-4 levels), performed at the time of the tumor resection. Pathology revealed a T2 stage tumor, indicating a tumor size of at least 2 cm but no greater than 4 cm, with no involvement of regional lymph nodes (N0). The pathological staging was therefore N0, T2. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was not administered. The last follow-up was conducted on 12/3/2012, and at that time, there was no evidence of disease.
