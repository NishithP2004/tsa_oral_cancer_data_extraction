The patient is a 49-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on March 20, 2017. The initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Pathology revealed a T2 tumor, indicating a greater extent of local invasion, and a clinically N1 nodal status, meaning there was evidence of lymph node involvement. Despite the N1 nodal status, no further nodes were identified during the surgery. Following the initial surgery, the patient underwent adjuvant therapy, although the specific type is not detailed in this summary. Last follow-up on May 20, 2017, indicated no evidence of disease. It is important to note that this assessment is based solely on the provided summary of the initial encounter and subsequent follow-up.
