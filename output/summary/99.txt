This 67-year-old male patient presented with an oral cancer, specifically a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, located on the tongue. The cancer was surgically removed on December 24, 2020, following a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to the tumor's location. Pathology confirmed the tumor as T1, indicating a small primary tumor. Importantly, no cancerous lymph nodes were identified (N0 staging) according to the 8th edition staging system. Post-surgery, the patient received no adjuvant therapy. At the last follow-up on March 27, 2021, there was no evidence of disease. The case represents a localized, early-stage oral cancer with complete surgical resection and no nodal involvement, ultimately resulting in no evidence of disease at the time of follow-up.
