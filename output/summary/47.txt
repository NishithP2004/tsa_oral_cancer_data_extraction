This patient is a 56-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on February 7, 2018. The initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection, revealing nodal involvement (N1 and N3b) requiring extensive staging according to the 8th Edition Clinical Tumor Staging System. The tumor was classified as T3 initially and later upgraded to T4a due to pathological findings. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was administered. Despite these interventions, the patient succumbed to the disease, remaining at state of ‘died with disease’ during the last follow-up on August 28, 2018. The tumor originated on the tongue, and bilateral nodal involvement was documented.”} </body></html>
