This 75-year-old male patient presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the lips, diagnosed on 6/4/2015. The initial tumor was classified as T4a, indicating extensive local invasion. Due to suspicion of metastasis, a selective neck dissection was performed (1-4 levels). Pathological examination revealed no nodal involvement (N0), despite the T4a classification. The patient subsequently received adjuvant therapy. At the last follow-up on 12/9/2019, there was no evidence of disease recurrence. This case demonstrates a locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma with initial nodal spread controlled by surgical intervention and adjuvant therapy, ultimately resulting in an excellent long-term outcome.
