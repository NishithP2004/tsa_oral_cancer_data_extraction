This 60-year-old female patient presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located in the alveolus subsite of the oral cavity. The tumor was initially diagnosed on January 25, 2017, and was classified as T4a, indicating a large tumor with potential for invasion into deeper tissues and/or adjacent structures. Given the T4a classification, a selective neck dissection was performed, resulting in no identified lymph node involvement (N0). The patient received no adjuvant therapy following the initial surgery. Despite the initial surgical findings, the patient ultimately succumbed to other causes, indicating a possible delayed or extensive metastatic process, although the final cause of death is not directly attributable to the oral cancer itself. The last follow-up was also January 25, 2017.
