This 47-year-old male patient presented with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma originating in the tongue. The tumor was surgically removed on March 22, 2018, following a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concern for regional lymph node involvement. Pathological examination revealed a T3 tumor and clinically staged N2c nodal involvement according to the 8th edition of the clinical tumor staging system. Microscopic examination confirmed a pathological N2a nodal status. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. At the last follow-up on October 16, 2019, there was no evidence of disease. The treatment plan and subsequent follow-up were successful in controlling the oral cancer.
