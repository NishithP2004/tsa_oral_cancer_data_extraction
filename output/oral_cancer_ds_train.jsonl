Not\n\nassociated with any pain, but complained of burning sensation while having food.The disease was initially\n\nevaluated with a biopsy at Kottayam Medical College, (no reports) but there was no malignancy. He was\n\nworking in UAE after this. During this period the lesion has been increasing in size and he was ignoring it.Then\n\nhe came to Aleppey Medical College and there he was evaluted with a biopsy , showed Squamous\n\nCarcinoma.(bystander reporting to op , has no reports) Hence he came here for further management. He was seen\n\ninitially at Head and Neck OPD, On examination there was a 4 cm ulceroproliferative growth on the left side\n\nbuccal mucosa anteriorly reaching opposite first molar, inferiorly reaching mucosa of lower third molar region,\n\nrest of the lower GBS free. Superiorly lesion involves upper GBS and extends superiorly into the anterior\n\nmaxillary soft tissue. Medially lesion extends to hard palate around the upper third molar, not crossing midline.\n\nPosteriorly lesion involves RMT region. GL sulcus, Tonsils free.\n\nNeck: Left prefacial lymph node is palpable, 1.5x1.5 cm, soft, mobile. clinically T3N1M0\n\nCT scan done on 15/2/12, showed asymmetrically thickened left sided buccal mucosa with maximum thickness\n\nmeasuring 2.2cm. The lesion is causing minimal bony erosion of mandile on left side at the site of last molar\n\nteeth. Left sided level II lymphadenopathy with largest one size measuring 1.4x0.9cm. Bilateral level III cervical\n\nlymphadenopathy with largest one size measuring 1.23x0.81cm.The case was discussed in the tumor board , and\n\nwas planned for surgery, underwent Wide local excision+ neck disection+ ALT flap on 6-03-2012. Post op HPR\n\nshowed Well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nTumor size : 5x2.5x1.9cms. Deep inked margin 0.4cm away. Depth of invasion is 5mm. All other margins are\n\nfree and well away.\n\n26 reactive nodes\n\nHe was then referred to Radiation Oncology for adjuvant radiation after tumour board recommended the same.\n\nIn view of the close deep margin, concurrent chemoradiation was considered, but because of the oroantral fistula\n\nand poor general condition, it was decided to omit chemotherapy and to go ahead with adjuvant radiation\n\ntreatment 66Gy in 33 fractions with 3DCRT. He was on NG tube feeds. CT simulation was done on 19.4.2012\n\nafter pre RT dental prophylaxis.\n\nINVESTIGATIONS :\n\nHaemogram:\n\nDate: Hb: g/dl PCV: % PLT:\n\nku/ml\n\nTC:\n\nku/ml\n\nDC: N % L:% E: % ESR:\n\nmm/1st hr\n\n25/04/2012 11.6 35.7 365.0 7.2 58.6 31.7 2.76 -\n\n29/04/2012 12.5 37.7 333.0 5.82 67.0 24.9 1.43 -\n\n07/05/2012 12.2 37.4 337.0 6.24 50.3 38.1 3.89 -\n\n14/05/2012 12.7 39.0 322.0 6.62 75.0 12.0 3.31 -\n\n21/05/2012 13.2 44.0 377.0 5.96 70.6 16.7 4.68 -\n\n29/05/2012 13.5 40.2 325.0 5.01 66.2 18.1 5.24 -\n\n06/06/2012 11.7 35.2 297.0 4.5 74.3 10.9 6.03 -\n\nLiver Function Test:\n\nDate: T.\n\nBilirubin:\n\nmg/dl\n\nD.\n\nBilirubin:\n\nmg/dl\n\nSGOT:\n\nIU/L\n\nSGPT:\n\nIU/L\n\nALP:\n\nIU/L\n\nT.\n\nProtein:\n\ngms/dl\n\nS.

Right sided level II and III nodes were hard multiple and fixed, the IJV was involved with disease and hence an MRND was done on the right side Patient under GA parts were painted and draped Cervical skin crease incision taken at the level of thyroid notch extending bilaterally Subplatysmal flaps were elevated upto the level of mandible above The Level IA nodes with fibrofatty tissue was cleared Bilateral Level IB with submandibular gland was cleared preserving the facial vessels on either sides Right level II and III multiple hard fixed nodes were present, The nodes with fibrofatty tissue and the IJV was removed Right Level IV nodes with fibrofatty tissue was cleared SAN, Carotids were preserved Left Level II, II and IV nodes with fibrofatty tissue was cleared preserving the SAN, IJV and Carotids The anterior belly of digastric was released from its attachment to the mandible Mylohyoid muscle was release followed by the geniohyoid and genioglossus muscles from their attachment at the lower and upper genoid tubercle respectively The FOM was entered by releasing the muscosal attachment from the lingual side of the mandible and the tongue was pulled through into the neck in toto Grossly the disease was found to be involving the right side of the tongue crossing the midline to the left side Left BOT was free of disease and with adequate margins sub total glossectomy leaving behind the left BOT was done Inferiorly the disease was found to be involving thehyoid on the left side hence part of the right hyoid cornu ws excised with the specimen Large conglomerate of nodes and mass lateral to the thyroif cartilage on the right side was sent separately Bilaterally no 14 romovac drains were placed The defect consisted of a near total glossectomy, with the entire FOM and soft tissue upto the level of hyoid. Left Large ALT flap was harvested Inset was done in two layers the musculofascial part of the flap was used to reconstruct the FOM muscles and the vallecular region The skin with the remaining muscle layers were used to provide bulk of the tongue and a second layer of FOM Anastomosis was done on the right side with the facial artery and EJV Incision closed in layers RECONSTRUCTION NOTE Procedure-ALT free flap cover under GA on 13/2/2020 Position- Supine Under aseptic precautions, parta painted and draped Left thigh ALT free flap harvest: Skin paddle: 15x6cm. Markings done. Perforator identified with the hand held doppler and skin paddle of above dimension marked around it. Medial incision was given and extended distally as well as proximally. Rectus femoris was muscle identified as a bipennate muscle. The dissection was continued in subfascial plane from medial to lateral till the intermuscular septum between rectus femoris and vastus lateralis. 2 musculocutaneous perforator was identified. Dissection proceeded along the intramuscular septum to identify the pedicle, descending branch of lateral circumflex femoral artery and the intermuscular perforator entering the muscle. The perforator was dissected along with a portion of muscle around it. The pedicle was dissected till the main vessel, clipping and dividing all the branches. Posterior cut was given and the flap was delivered by dividing the pedicle. Donor site closed primarily using 2-0 vicryl and stapler after achieving haemostasis and placing the drain. Inset done and anastomosis done to facial artery and external jugular vein(end to side) using 9-0 nylon in right side of neck.

She underwent WLE (right and left lateral tongue lesion) bilateral SND (LEVELS I-IV) with shape modified RFFF with tracheostomy under GA 12.03.2020. Post operatively her flap showed congestion and therefore underwent Re-exploration for flap congestion under GA on 13.03.2020. Her post operative period was uneventful with no major issues. All drains were removed on POD 2. Her alternate neck sutures and hand clips were removed on POD 8 and rest on POD 9. She was started on oral feeds, tolerated well and hence RT was removed on POD 8. At the time of discharge, patient is stable and afebrile.\nOPERATIVE FINDINGS : \n\nprocedure- WLE (right and left lateral tongue lesion) bilateral SND (LEVELS I-IV) with shape modified RFFF with tracheostomy under GA Findings- 2x2cm ulcer over right lateral border with central slough and 1x1cm ulcer on left lateral border of tongue. right level Ib and IIa/b small nodes Under GA with all aseptic precautions. transverse upper skin crease incision taken from angle of mandible on one side to opposite side angle of mandible. Subplatysmal flaps elevated. bl level I-IV SND done, preserving marginal mandibular nerve, spinal accessory and IJV on both sides. Wide local excision of both the lesions done with 1 cm margins in 3 dimensions. specimen oriented and sent for HPE. hemostasis achieved. shape modified RFFF harvested from right forearm with skin paddle measuring 13x3cm with pedicle length of approx 8cm and cephalic vein was also harvested. Central area of Skin paddle de-epithelialized. a submucosal tunnel made along ventral aspect of tongue such that majority of flap used to cover right sided defect with de-epithelialized segment tunneled through the submucosal pocket and distal part of flap used for covering left sided tongue defect. tunnel made in floor of mouth on right side posterior to myelohyoid, to pass the pedicle with cephalic vein to right side of neck. Microanastomosis done to right facial artery and vein. closure of neck done in layers over a suction and gloved drain. RFFF donor site closed primarily over a suction drain. Tracheostomy done. Procedure uneventful. Re-exploration for flap congestion under GA on 13.03.2020 Findings- acute kink in the pedicle under GA with all aseptic precautions, sutures opened and pedicle exposed. acute kink in the pedicle identified compromising venous drainage. Adventitia dissected at the site of kink and pieces of ab gel kept between the pedicle to prevent kinking. Cephalic vein anastomosed with EJV.

CT chest was done on 18/01/2011 showed nodular lesion in left upper lobe anterior segment -? Deposit. Ultrasound of abdomen was done on 19/1/2011, which showed cholelithiasis. Both kidneys showed raised cortical echotexture. MDCT of Head and Neck was done on 18/01/2011 showed irregular soft tissue lesion involving left cheeck with extension, right orbital Preseptal soft tissue lesion ? deposit and cervical lymphadenopathy. Wholebody scan was done on 20/01/2011 reported as no evidence of any skeletal metastases. FNAC was done on 20/01/2011 reported as suggestive of abscess. His case was discussed in the Head and Neck tumour board and it was decided to treat him with surgery. He underwent wide local excision + maxilectomy + Left hemi mandibulectomy + bilateral neck dissection +ALT flap reconstruction +Skin grafting + Tracheostomy under GA on 1-02-2011. Postoperative period was uneventful. PEG placement was done on 12/02/2011 for better nutrition. Radiation Oncology consultation was sought for the adjuvant treatment, since the patient had maximum dose of radiation to brain stem and spinal cord, re radiation impossible.

He was monitored in the for the first 3 days. On POD3 the flap bleeding was inadequate for which he was re-explored. After re-exploration the flap bleeding was still slowed. The following morning the flap was not bleeding for which he was re-explored, flap was debrided and radial forearm free flap reconstruction was performed. Post operatively he was stable, started on RT feeds and ambulated. He was shifted out of the ICU on POD5 after decannulation. A small collection in the neck was drained for which he was started on injectable antibiotics. He is now comfortable, tolerating RT feeds and pain-free, fit for discharge. He has not had a trial oral feed as of yet\nOPERATIVE FINDINGS : \n\nfindings: ulceroinfiltrative lesion involving left lateral border of tongue 3x3cm extending onto floor of mouth upto mylohyiod. b/l level IIA, left Lvel IB showed suspicious lymphadenopathy. procedure: WLE excision of tongue lesion done with 1cm margin where right posterior third of right lateral boder was the only remnant tongue. excision done enblos with left FOM including mylohyiod muscle. b/l SND done. left level IB shows infiltrating lesion involving submnadibular gland, mylohiod and hypoglossal nerve, which where removed. b/l level I-IV clearance done. reconstruction done with ALY flap. with posterior inset to BOT.

Total glossectomy + Bilateral neck dissection (I-IV) + Gastroomental flap + Gracilis flap + Tracheostomy on 13-09-2011 under GA 2. Re-exploration + vascular anastamosis of gastroomental flap on 16-09-2011 under GA 3. Debridement + Radial forearm free flap on 20-09-2011 under GA\nHISTORY : \n\n27 year old Mr. Binu presented to Head and Neck OPD with complaints of ulcer on the right lateral border of tongue noticed initially as a small lesion six months back, treated conservatively by a local practitioner. The lesion progressively increased to the present size over the last six months. Came here for further management \nCLINICAL EXAMINATION : \n\nExamination revealed about 6X4 cm ulceroproliferative growth on the right lateral border of oral tongue, induration crossing midline and involving the oropharyngeal tongue. Lesion reaches floor of mouth and is abutting the gingiva. Clinically alveolus does not appear eroded. Approximately 1.5 x 1.5 cm right level II, III and left level II firm lymph nodes palpable, with restricted mobility. \n\nINVESTIGATIONS :\n\nHaemogram:\n\nDate:\n\nHb: g/dl\n\nPCV: %\n\nPLT: ku/ml\n\nTC: ku/ml\n\nDC: N %\n\nL: %\n\nE: %\n\nESR: mm/1st hr\n\n15/09/2011\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n91.4\n\n4.35\n\n-\n\n-\n\n16/09/2011\n\n-\n\n-\n\n186.0\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n17/09/2011\n\n10.9\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n18/09/2011\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n8.88\n\n-\n\n-\n\n19/09/2011\n\n-\n\n25.0\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n20/09/2011\n\n-\n\n25.9\n\n-\n\n10.5\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n21/09/2011\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n7.43\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n22/09/2011\n\n9.37\n\n27.4\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n23/09/2011\n\n-\n\n-\n\n286.0\n\n11.0\n\n86.9\n\n6.69\n\n-\n\n-\n\n27/09/2011\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n9.89\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n28/09/2011\n\n-\n\n-\n\n673.0\n\n8.93\n\n73.2\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nRenal Function Test and Serum Electrolytes:\n\nDate:\n\nUrea: mg/dl\n\nCreatinine: mg/dl\n\nNa+: mEq/L\n\nK+: mEq/L\n\n15/09/2011\n\n-\n\n-\n\n136.1\n\n-\n\n16/09/2011\n\n-\n\n-\n\n134.6\n\n3.52\n\n21/09/2011\n\n-\n\n-\n\n138.9\n\n3.61\n\n22/09/2011\n\n18.6\n\n0.56\n\n-\n\n-\n\n23/09/2011\n\n16.0\n\n0.6\n\n133.4\n\n3.45\n\n24/09/2011\n\n13.8\n\n0.58\n\n-\n\n-\n\n25/09/2011\n\n-\n\n-\n\n131.6\n\n4.12\n\n26/09/2011\n\n17.7\n\n0.62\n\n-\n\n-\n\nDate: 28/09/2011 \n\nMPV-Blood : 7.02 fL \n\nMONO -Blood : 10.4 % \nBASO-Blood : 0.558 % \nDate: 27/09/2011 \n\nRBC-COUNT-Blood : 3.22 M/uL \n\nMCHC-Blood : 34.3 g/dl \nRDW-Blood : 14.9 % \n\nMPV-Blood : 8.39 fL \n\nDate: 24/09/2011 \n\nMCH-Blood : 27.9 pg \n\nMCHC-Blood : 33.2 g/dl \nRDW-Blood : 15.0 % \n\nMPV-Blood : 8.38 fL \n\nDate: 23/09/2011 \n\nPT[Prothrombin Time with INR]-Plasma : 16.8/14.60/1.18 sec \n\nMCH-Blood : 28.4 pg \nMCHC-Blood : 34.8 g/dl \n\nRDW-Blood : 14.8 % \n\nDate: 21/09/2011 \n\nRBC-COUNT-Blood : 3.33 M/uL \n\nMCV-Blood : 81.7 fL \nMCH-Blood : 28.7 pg \n\nMCHC-Blood : 35.1 g/dl \nRBC-COUNT-Blood : 2.85 M/uL \nDate: 20/09/2011 \n\nPT[Prothrombin Time with INR]-Plasma : 13.7/14.60/0.93 sec \n\nRBC-COUNT-Blood : 3.17 M/uL \nMCV-Blood : 81.5 fL \nDate: 19/09/2011 \n\nMCV-Blood : 81.5 fL \n\nMCH-Blood : 24.5 pg \nMCHC-Blood : 30.1 g/dl \n\nRDW-Blood : 14.1 % \nMPV-Blood : 7.27 fL \nDate: 18/09/2011 \n\nMCV-Blood : 81.3 fL \n\nMCH-Blood : 27.9 pg \nMCHC-Blood : 34.3 g/dl \n\nMONO -Blood : 6.77 % \n\nDate: 17/09/2011 \n\nRBC-COUNT-Blood : 3.95 M/uL \n\nMCV-Blood : 81.3 fL \nMCH-Blood : 27.5 pg \n\nMCHC-Blood : 33.9 g/dl \nRDW-Blood : 14.1 % \nDate: 16/09/2011 \n\nBASO-Blood : 0.194 % \nDate: 15/09/2011 \n\nMCH-Blood : 27.6 pg \n\nMCHC-Blood : 33.9 g/dl \nRDW-Blood : 14.6 % \nDate: 12/09/2011 \n\nAnti HCV - Emergency Screen : 0.05Non Reactive \n\nHIV - Emergency Screen(P24 Ag and HIV 1 and 2 Ab) : 0.05Non Reactive \nSurgical Pathology Report Service :Histopath-Excision biopsy (small) Received on :27/08/2011 Reported Date :29/08/2011 Histology Lab No :S11 - 9615 Microscopy and Impression : Bx Right lateral border of tongue ulcer : Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma MDCT NECK - CONTRAST Date : 27/08/2011 IMPRESSION Neoplastic lesion in left side of tongue crossing midline extending to floor of mouth and probably involving the submandibular gland.

Biopsy was done on 27-08-2011, revealed as moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. MDCT neck(Contrast) was done on 27-08-2011 showed neoplastic lesion in left side of tongue crossing midline extending to floor of mouth and probably involving the submandibular gland and bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy probably metastatic nodes. PET done on 31-08-2011 is negative for distant mets. His case was discussed in Head and Neck tumour board and decided to treat him with surgery(TB plan : total glossectomy +Bil ND+ double flap + intra op PEG insertion). He was admitted on 12-09-2011 and after all preliminary investigations and evalution he was taken up for surgery. He underwent Total glossectomy + Bilateral neck dissection (I-IV) + Gastro-omental flap + Gracilis flap + Tracheostomy on 13-09-2011 under GA. On the third postoperative day, gastro-omental flap found to compramised and he was taken up for re-exploration + vascular anastamosis of gastro-omental flap on 16-09-2011 under GA and later he underwent debridement + Radial forearm free flap on 20-09-2011 under GA. Postoperatively he developed neck wound gaping and managed conservatively with twice daily dressing. Tracheostomy tube decannulated at the time of discharge. Based on the final pathology report he is planned for postoperative adjuvant chemoradiation. Medical and Radiation oncology consultation was sought for the same. Dental consultation was sought for pre RT dental prophylaxis. Condition at discharge: Stable,afebrile, ambulating, tracheostomy tube decannulated, on FJ feeds, discharge from the neck wound reduced. \nOPERATIVE FINDINGS : \n\n1. Under general anesthesia.

Post operative period was uneventful. At the time of discharge patient stable and wound healthy.\nOPERATIVE FINDINGS : \n\nFindings: 4 x 3 cm lesion in anterior FOM with mandible involvement + Level 1b node stuck to the mandible laterally + Left Level 2 ,3 and 4 nodes ++++ , Level 2 node was involving the SAN and closely dissected out of the IJV + Right Level 1b nodes+++ Procedure: Under GA with all aseptic precautions , B/l Transverse skin crease incision combined with a miline lip split incision , subplatysmal flaps raised . After preplating , Segmental mandibulectomy done from right lateral incisor to the the angle of the mandible(as the level 1b node was involving the mandible) on the left side with adequate margin.The whole specimen with left level 1b node taken out intoto. SCM dissected on its medial border to expose the Spinal accessory nerve, internal jugular vein and the carotid artery. Left Level 2 ,3 and 4 nodes ++++ , Level 2 node was involving the SAN, so it was sacrificed and closely dissected out of the IJV . Specimen completely separated from the IJV and delivered. Right side Level 1 to 4 dissection also completed. Segmental defect of 10 cm corrected with FFFF harvested form the right leg with one osteotomy and FOM defect corrected with the skin paddle of the FFFF. Anastomosis done to left facial artery and Left EJV. Drains kept .Hemostasis achieved and wound closed in layers .Post procedure uneventful. Free fibula flap notes: Incision is given at the anterior border of the fibula (after marking a skin paddle on 12x 7 cm) at the lower third curving gently anteriorly over peroneus musculature at midpoint the curve is gently back to end about 2 cm above the lateral malleolus over the fibula bone. Skin flap is elevated from anteriorly under the peroneus muscular fascia. Single large septocutaneous perforator identified at the inferior third . Posterior incision down to soleus given, skin paddle elevated anteriorly and perforator preserved. Peroneus muscles are seperated from fibula.Anterior interosseus menbrane divided, anterior neruvascular bundle preserved and EHL muscles seperated away.Interosseus membrane identified and cut. Bone cuts are given with giglgy saw 5 cm from lower end and 6 cm from upper end of fibula. With lateral retraction of fibula, anterior dissection of the muscles off of fibula are done leaving FHL muscle more inferiorly since the peroneal artery exited the fibula inferiorly at halfway length. The artery and venae comitantes are traced proximally and the posterior tibial artery and veins traced till the common peroneal. Haemostasis secured. Closure is done over suction drains with SSG. A posterior splint is applied with the ankle in dorsiflexion. Single osteotomy done with power saw and bone adapted onto the already contoured reconstruction plate in place and fixed with 10 mm screws.Flap inset onto the floor of mouth and tongue base.\nPROGNOSIS ON DISCHARGE : \n\nGood \nADVICE ON DISCHARGE : \nDIET RECOMMENDATIONS : \n\nHigh protein diet \nPHYSICAL ACTIVITY : \n\nNormal\nDISCHARGE MEDICATION : \n\nTab Ciplox 500mg 1-0-1 X 2 days Tab Dolo 650 mg 1-1-1 SOS Tab Pan 40 mg 1-0-0 SOS Tab Ultracet 1tab SOS (if pain) Tab Thyronorm 150mcg OD to continue \nHEAD AND NECK - TUMOUR BOARD \nPrevious Treatment History: \nTreatment: Complete \n\nModality: Surgery + CRT \nStage: \nT: T2 \n\nN: N3 \nM: M0 \nSite: Oral Cavity \nDescriptive History and Examination: \n\nK/C/O Carcinoma floor of mouth cT4N2bM0 WLE + Segmental mandibulectomy + B/l SND (1 to 4) + FFFF reconstruction of the defect + SSG for donor site skin defect + Tracheostomy under GA on 27/03/2017 HPER: pT2N3 (AJCC 8th edition) Completed concurrent CT on 31/8 2017 and RT on 11/7/17 at kottayam medical college on regular follow up no complaints o/e KPS 80 mouth opening adequate oral : 5x5mm whitish indurated lesion over right FOM Neck : NED \nComments: \n\nHypothyroid\nTumour Characteristics: \nOral Cavity: FOM \nLength (mm): \n\n5\n\nBreadth (mm): \n\n5\nSide: Right \nPremalignant/Feild Cancerisation: No \nPrimary: \n\nCarcinoma in situ with suspicious invasion. \nDiagnosis and Stage: \nSite: Oral cavity \n\nSide: Right \nStage: \nT1 \n\nN0 \n\nM0 \nPresentation: Recurence \nDescriptive Plan: \n\nRecurrent Carcinoma Right FOM cT1N0M0 CTHN CXR Plan: WLE imaging awaited\nHEAD AND NECK - TUMOUR BOARD \nTB Date: \n\n24/08/2022\n\nDiagnosis date: \n\n17/08/2022\n\nTumour Type: Second Primary \nPrevious Treatment History: \nTreatment: Complete \nPrevious HPR: \n\nModerately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, floor of mouth. - Tumour size: 1.6x1x0.9cm. - Depth of invasion : 0.9cm - Invasive front: Noncohesive Lymphocytic host response : Brisk PNI - absent LVE - Absent Bony invasion - absent Margin clearance: Tumour is 2mm from right posterior soft tissue and 3mm from right posterior mucosal margin.

He developed neck abscess which was drained and daily dressings were done. At the time of discharge: vitals stable,,Sutures removed.\nOPERATIVE FINDINGS : \n\nNear total glossectomy+B/L SND (I-IV)+ALT flap reconstruction+tracheostomy under GA Findings: Moderate trismus noted. Ulcerative lesion noted in the right lateral tongue roughly 2x2 cm, however submucosal induration involved almost the entire middle third of the tongue. Uninvolved portion of the tongue was left posterior tongue 2 cm in from th eof the circumvallate papillae. Deep extension of the tumour was up to the extrinsic muscles - digastric and mylohyoid were uninvolved. Bilateral enlarged nodes noted in right and left level IIA, largest 2.5x2 cm in size Procedure: Transverse neck crease incision placed at the level of the thyroid notch and subplatysmal flaps raised till just above the lower border of the mandible. Level IA and IB neck dissection performed and bilateral facial vessels preserved with long stumps. Digastric muscle insertion freed from the central arch attachment and mylohoid freed through blunt dissection. Geniohyoid muscle cut flush to the mandible attachment. Intraoral cut placed at the alveolar mucosa and subperiosteal dissection performed to perform a pull-through. Bilateral tonsillolingual sulcus and styloglossus tendons cut under vision to improve exposure. WLE performed with 1 cm circumferential margin. Both lingual arteries ligated at the resection stump. Bilateral levels II-IV cleared preserving SAN, SCM and IJV. Hemostasis achieved. Flap inset with epithelialized portion of the flap functioning as dorsum of the neo-tongue and the de-epithelialized portion tucked into the floor of mouth defect with the fascia lata fixed to the mandible with 3-0 PDS to prevent leak. Tongue stump was sutured to the flap edge. Water-seal confirmed. Neck closed in layers with platysmal 3-0 vicryl and interrupted 4-0 nylon for skin closure after 2x14F suction drains placed. Tracheostomy performed in 2nd tracheal ring with size 7.5 double lumen cuffed Portex tube, Reconstruction notes: ALT free flap done for total glossectomy defect done under GA on 22/03/18 Notes: Part painted and draped. Markings done. Skin perforator identified with the ahnd held doppler and skin paddle marked around it. Medial incision given and extended distally as well as proximally. Rectus femoris muscle identified as a bipennate muscle. The dissection continued in subfacial plane from medial to lateral till the intermuscular septum between rectus femoris and vastus lateralis. A musculocutaneous perforator identified. Dissection proceeded along the i.m.septum to identify the pedicle, descending branch of lateral circumflex femoral artery and the intermuscular perforator entering the muscle. The perforator dissected along with a cuff of muscle around it. The pedicle dissected till the main vessel, clipping and dividing all the branches. Posterior cut given and the flap delivered by dividing the pedicle. Donor site closed primarily after achieving haemostasis and placing the drain. Inset done and anastomosis done to facial artery and vein. Closure done in layers.\nDISCHARGE MEDICATION : \n\nTab.Pan 40 mg 1-0-0 X 5 Days. Tab.Dolo 650 mg 1-1-1 X 5 Days.

Esophagus: Normal Stomach: Normal Duodenum : Normal A 24 Fr Wilson cook PEG tube was placed under aseptic precautions via the pull technique. No post procedure complications. Impression/Recommendation PEG placement done\nCOURSE IN THE HOSPITAL AND DISCUSSION : \n\nPatient brought to the hospital with above mentioned complaints. After all investigation and evaluation patient was taken for the surgery. He underwent Left radial forearm free flap harvest under GA on 1/9/16. Left radial forearm donor site re-exploration under GA on 2/9/16. And the post operative period was uneventful.\nOPERATIVE FINDINGS : \n\n11 OT Diagnosis: Ca.FOM Surgery: WLE + segmental mandibulectomy + b/l SND + Fibula free flap+ RFFF + tracheostomy under GA. Findings: Infiltrative lesion in the FOM and the ventral tongue. 3 c 3 cms in size. Under GA.Lip split, b/l neck transverse incision. Bilateral level 1 dissection done. cheek flap elevated. Mandible exposed and pre-plated. Fom lesion marked out with margins and ventral/anterior tongue included in the specimen. Segmental mandibulectomy + wle done. B/l I-IV ND done. Fibula flap harvested from the right leg based on the peroneal artery and single sc perforator. Fibula detached, osteotomised and inset into the mandibular defect. Anastamosis to the right facial artery and facial vein. Radial forearm harvested from the left arm. Rfff inset into the tongue defect. Anastamosis to the left facial artery and vein. Skin paddle of fibula not perfusing well at the end of the operation. Hence perforator of fibula skin paddle anastamosed to the end of the radial artery in the RFFF. Bleeding confirmed. wound closed with 3-0 vicryl and 4-0 nylon. SSG for both fibula and RFFF donor site.Tracheostomy with 8 double lumen portex tube. Left radial forearm free flap harvest under GA by Dr SI/KK/BD/Narayana on 1/9/16: Skin paddle of around 5x4 cm marked and radial artery and cephalic vein marked. Distal and medial aspects of flap skin incised and raised. Incision deepened till the deep fascia. Cephalic vein and radial artery with venae comitantes identified and ligarted distal to the flap. Sensory branch of radial cutaneous nerve identified and flap portion divided. Cephalic vein and radial artery freed and traced proximally. Radial artery divided just proximal to the confluence, cephalic vein divided at the same level. Flap disconnected. Haemostasis achieved and closure performed in layers after placing 14F suction drain and use of a split skin graft harvested from right thigh. Left radial forearm donor site re-exploration under GA on 2/9/16 by Dr SI/KK/DB/Janardhanan/Shashikant/Narayana Findings: Previous sutures opened and pedicle explored. Radial artery ligated at the confluence with brachial artery, knot from tie was compressed the ulnar artery causing minimal compression and early contusion. Tie was released, however in view of contusion it was decided to excise the segment and replace with a vein graft. Great saphenous vein graft of around 5 cm harvested from right thigh. Proximal ulnar artery excised uptil brachial confluence, around 4 cm. Two end to end anastomoses performed between the brachial artery and the distal end of vein graft, and the proximal end of vein graft and the ulnar artery with nylon 8-0. Patency confirmed. SpO2 in the radial artery territory was confirmed as 100%. 14F drain placed and forearm closed in layers. Skin graft reapplied with tie-over and dressing applied. \nADVICE ON DISCHARGE : \n\nTo review in Head and Neck OPD on 01.10.2016 ( dr deepak b.)\nDIET RECOMMENDATIONS : \n\nPEG feeds at the rate of 2.5 liters per day\nPHYSICAL ACTIVITY : \n\nNormal\nDISCHARGE MEDICATION : \n\nTab Pan 40 mg x 5 days Tab Dolo 650 mg x 5 days tab linezolid 600 mg 1-0-1 5 days tab chymoral forte 1-1-1 for 5 days tab clonazepam 0.5 mg HS T BACT onitment for local application 1-1-1 soframycin onitment 1-1-1 cabipro powder saline nebulization\nTumour Board Discussion\n\nRelevant clinical details :\n\npatient presented with lesion in the floor of the tongue and right side of the neck ,biopsy showed from FOM\n\ninvasive squamous cell carcinoma - moderately differentiated grade with desmoplatic stromal reaction.

After all preliminary investigation and evaluation patient taken for the surgery. peri and post operative periods were uneventful.\nOPERATIVE FINDINGS : \n\nUnder GA with nasotracheal intubation patient was taken. Per oral wide local excision of tongue was done preserving part of base tongue on both sides. Specimen taken for grossing to confirm adequate resection margin . Transverse cervical skin crease incision kept and Bilateral selective neck dissection was done preserving BL Marginal nerve, IJV, SCM, and Spinal accessory nerve. Left 7x5 cm ALT fasciocutaneous flap was harvested for defect reconstruction .Microvascular anastomosis was done on left facial artey and branch to IJV . Flap inset was done with interdental sutures. ALT site was closed Primarily. Neck wound closed in layers keeping BL Fr14 drains. tracheostomy done with double lumen portex 8.0. Patient shifted to ICU confirming flap perfusion. Re exploration under GA on 27.10.2016 reason: salivary seepage into neck with doubtful flap ischemia, hematoma in neck\nProcedure: Under GA with, the neck was re explored. Hematoma found in both sides of neck with salivary seepage and small bleeder were seen from a branch from the lingual vein on the right side.Bleeders were controlled.The vein anastomosis and the arterial anastomosis found to be thrombosed. Arterial anastomosis redone to Superior thyroid artery and vein anastomosis redone to EJV via a Cephalic vein graft. Part of the flap was seen to be viable after the procedure. Flap debridement and PMMC flap reconstruction under GA on 27.10.2016 Findings: Flap non viable Procedure : Under GA , flap was debrided and the vessels used for anastomosis was ligated and cut and Left side PMMC flap was lifted and inset into the defect. Flap Anchor sutures was taken in drilled holes in the lower part of mandible with PDS sutures and a further one more layer of sutures were taken for oro - neck separation by suturing the pedicle fascia to the submandibular area.

Plastic Reconstructive Surgery Notes Reconstruction notes- ALT flap harvested from Rt thigh measuring about 7X7 cms with one perforater supplying the flap. Donor site closed with skin graft. Anastomosis done with facial artery and tributory just joing the IJV. Drains palced and closed in layers POD 2- Pt was reexplored on 30 10 14, Both artery and vein thrombosis was present hence flap was debrided and RAFF flap measuring 7X5 cms harvested from left forearm and inset done in subtotal glossectomy defect. Anastomosis done with lt superior thyroid artery and lt common facial vein. Flap was bleeding well wound closed in layers after placing drains. 2.Re exploration and Debridement + Left Radial Forearm free flap under GA on 30-10-21014 Procedure: Under GA, Free Radial Artery Forearm Flap Dimensions(7X5 cm) marked on Lt hand after draping and marking, tornique applied. Medial longitudinal skin incision is given. Suprafacial Dissection done medial to lateral using tenotomy scissors without damaging the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve traveling in the muscular fascia. As dissection proceeds laterally, subfascial dissection done over the palmaris longus tendon (if present) and the flexor carpi radialis tendon without damaging the paratenon on these tendons. The radial longitudinal skin incision given and performed lateral-to-medial subfascial /suprafacial dissection over the large brachioradialis. The dorsal radial nerve is preserved. Brachioradialis tendon is widely undermined the and retracted it laterally. The radial artery pedicle is dissected distally. The cephalic vein is included / not included in the harvest. Fasciocutaneous paddle is pedicled by only the lateral intermuscular septum and the radial artery pedicle. Proximally, incision from the skin paddle to the antecubital fossa is given. Then, performed subcutaneous dissection to elevate skin flaps medially and laterally. Followed the radial artery pedicle to the antecubital fossa using microclips or bipolar cautery on small vascular branches between the pedicle and underlying musculature. Donor area closed .SSG done. Flap harvested and insetted into the oral cavity. 3.Heamatoma evacuation+ Resuturing done on 11-11-2014\nADVICE ON DISCHARGE : \n\nReview after 2 weeks in Head and Neck OPD\nDIET RECOMMENDATIONS : \n\nPEG FEEDS 2.5 L per day\nDISCHARGE MEDICATION : \n\nTab.

FNAC was done on 1-02-2013, which showed left and right level IB nodes and submental nodes - Negative for metastasis in a k/c/o ca alveolus. MDCT neck with contrast was done on 6-02-2013, which showed Soft tissue mass eroding the alveolar margin of body of mandible with cervical adenopathy. Her case was discussed in Head and Neck tumour board and planned for surgery. She was admitted on 18-02-2013 and after all preliminary investigations and evaluation she was taken for surgery. She underwent Anterior segmental mandibulectomy + Bilateral level 1-4 Neck Dissection + Free fibula flap + tracheostomy on 19-02-2013 under GA. On the second postoperative day, flap found to be congested and taken up reexploration on 20-02-2013. She also had persistant fever postoperatively and started on Inj.Magnex 2 gm IV BD. Rset of the postoperative period was uneventful. Tracheostomy tube was decannulated on the fourth postoperative day. On the sixth postoperative day , she was started orally and Ryles tube removed at the time of discharge. Postoperatively she had fluctuating blood sugar values, hence Endocrinology consultation sought and managed as per their advise. Radiation Oncology consultation sought for planning adjuvant treatment. Dental consultation sought for Pre RT dental prophylaxis. Condition at discharge: Stable, afebrile, taking orally, all sutures and arch bar removed, Flap - healthy\nOPERATIVE FINDINGS : \n\nSurgery: Anterior segmental mandibulectomy + Bilateral level 1-4 ND + Free fibula flap + tracheostomy Findings: Tumor of mandibular alveolus extending in the gingivo - buccal sulcus from 2nd molar on the right side to the canine on the left side with destruction of the alveolus Multiple enlarged nodes on both sides of the neck in levels 1,2A and 3. Procedure: Midline Lip split and transverse neck crease incisions. Flaps raised and after preserving marginal mandibular on both sides, lower border of mandible identified after dissecting level 1A and bilateral Level 1B. Mucosal cuts made after marking 1 cm margin and bone cuts planned. A plate was bent to fit the defect and screwed over the mandible being preserved. Bone cuts taken and tumor excised. Bilateral level 2 - 4 ND done and drains fixed on both sides. Simultaneously a free fibula flap harvested from the left leg and after osteotomy cuts plated into the defect in the oral cavity and flap inset after anastomosing to the vessels in the neck. Tracheostomy done. Skin closed in layers.

After all preliminary ivestigation and evaluation he was taken up for surgery. He underwent Wide local Excision + Left ND (1-4) + Infrahyoid flap under GA on 18-04-2013. On the second post operative day patient was developed chyle leak and advised zero fat diet. USG abdomen done(20/04/2013) reported as bilateral mild pleural effusion (left > right). No ascites. On 26-04-2013, patient was disoriented, was shifted to ICU 1100 cc chyle leak aspirated. Patient was detected to have Hyponatremia, whcih was corrected. On the ninth post operative day flap was found to be necrosed and debridement done under LA. Repeated Chyle Leak Aspiration was performed under sterile conditions with a 20ml Syringe and a 18G needle, at the most dependent area of Collection in the Left Neck, Taking care to avoid injury to the great vessels in the neck. Aspiration accounted around 120 - 140 ml of Chyle. Compressive dressing was then put.Rest of the post operative period was uneventful. Condition at discharge:Afebrile,Vitals Stable,Sutures insitu. 14oml of Chyle aspirated. Dressing put.\nOPERATIVE FINDINGS : \n\nDiagnosis: Carcinoma Left lateral border of tongue Surgery: WLE + Left ND (1-4) + Infrahyoid flap Findings: A large 3 x 2 cm ulceroproliferative growth along the left lateral border of tongue. No significant nodes in the neck Procedure: Under GA, A 1 cm margin marked around the tumor and specimen excised and oriented. Defect was 6 x 5 cm. Infrahyoid flap marked in the left midline of neck and raised with strap muscles on left side over the left superior thyroid artery. The myocutaneous island flap brought into the oral cavity via the defect in FOM and inset with vicryl. Levels 1-4 ND done. Hemostasis secured. Wound closed over a suction drain in layers.\nADVICE ON DISCHARGE : \n\nReview after one week in Head and Neck OPD\nDIET RECOMMENDATIONS : \n\nFat free diet Via NG tube as advised by Dietician.\nPLAN ON DISCHARGE : \n\nTab.

Findings: Indurated lesion noted in the right side of dorsum of the tongue, crossing the midline into the left, just short of the left border, It measured roughly 4x3.5x3 cm in size. Pharyngeal tongue and floor of the mouth were free. On the right side a few enlarged nodes were seen in level II and II, on the left side a few enlarged nodes were seen in IB (prefacial region). However there were no frank signs of malignancy. Total glossectomy was performed per-orally with monopolar cautery, The extent of resection was 2 cm distal to pharyngeal tongue and inferiorly the incision was beveled to retain a small wedge of ventral tongue proximally. On the right, a wedge of floor of mouth was taken with mylohyoid muscle, whereas on the left floor of mouth was retained. Bilateral level I-IV selective neck dissection was performed, retaining the sternocleidomastoid, internal jugular vein and spinal accessory nerve. All nodal tissue was cleared in these levels. Hemostasis confirmed with valsalva maneouvre. Neck was closed in 2 layers - continuous suturing of platysma with 4-0 vicryl and skin with 4-0 nylon. Tracheostomy was performed through the second space.

Following this\n\nshe developed increasing pain and swelling over the region. No bleeding. Habitual tobacco chewer; continued\n\neven after the trauma. Keeps the tobacco in mouth for prolonged periods of time.\n\nShe was evaluated at Adayar. Biopsy taken there showed Infiltrative Squamous cell carcinoma, Grade II. She\n\ncame to here for further management and was evaluated here at Head and Neck surgery OPD.\n\nClinical Examination revealed a large ulcero-infiltrative lesion over right lateral border of tongue. Tumour about\n\n4 x 4 cm in dimension, extending to base of tongue. Tender on palpation. Induration palpated to cross the mid\n\nline. Scopy done showed lymphoid follicles over base of tongue. Neck: No lymphadenopathy. She was evaluated\n\nwith MRI neck with Contrast [Dated: 10.11.2015] which showed a well defined enhancing lesion noted\n\ninvolving the right lateral border and dorsum of oral tongue infiltrating the lingual septum and crossing the mid\n\nline measuring 32.4 x 22.5 x 28.1 mm (AP x TR x CC) (volume 10.7 cc). Pharyngeal tongue is free. The right\n\ngenioglossus, hyoglossus, styloglossus seems to be infiltrated. The right sublingual space is also involved.\n\nMyelohyoid is free. Bilateral suspicious rounded enhancing nodes noted in Ia, bilateral level Ib, II III largest\n\nnode in right level II measures 23.0 x 12.5 mm and largest node in level II measures 19 x 11 mm and in Ia\n\nmeasures 10.8 x 8.0 mm. The lesion shows an ADC of 0.00114 and normal size that of 0.00138. Cyst noted in\n\nright tonsilar fossa.\n\nShe was advised for surgery and after all pre operative evaluation and investigations she underwent Wide Local\n\nExcision + bilateral SND + ALT free flap + tracheostomy under GA on 16.11.2015.

She\n\nrequired adaptive planning because of weight loss and mask getting loose and hence same was done after 20\n\nfractions of radiation. She was advised 33 fractions, but due to financial constraints she could not complete the\n\nlast three fractions which was planned for the positive lymph nodal area with peri-nodal spread. The plan was\n\nreviewed and it was found that the peri-nodal area had received a dose of 62 to 63 Gy. Hence it was decided to\n\nstop radiation at 30 fractions, as she had also received concurrent chemotherapy.\n\nMrs Bina Biswas had grade II/III mucosal changes in the oral cavity, and grade I and II skin changes. The acute\n\nchanges were managed symptomatically and with support from pain and palliative care team.\n\nADVICES AT DISCHARGE, MEDICATIONS AND FURTHER PLAN\n\nFollow up pattern:\n\n1.

Findings: Indurated lesion noted in the right side of dorsum of the tongue, crossing the midline into the left, just short of the left border, It measured roughly 4x3.5x3 cm in size. Pharyngeal tongue and floor of the mouth were free. On the right side a few enlarged nodes were seen in level II and II, on the left side a few enlarged nodes were seen in IB (prefacial region). However there were no frank signs of malignancy. Total glossectomy was performed per-orally with monopolar cautery, The extent of resection was 2 cm distal to pharyngeal tongue and inferiorly the incision was beveled to retain a small wedge of ventral tongue proximally. On the right, a wedge of floor of mouth was taken with mylohyoid muscle, whereas on the left floor of mouth was retained. Bilateral level I-IV selective neck dissection was performed, retaining the sternocleidomastoid, internal jugular vein and spinal accessory nerve. All nodal tissue was cleared in these levels. Hemostasis confirmed with valsalva maneouvre. Neck was closed in 2 layers - continuous suturing of platysma with 4-0 vicryl and skin with 4-0 nylon. Tracheostomy was performed through the second space.

This lesion is T1Wand T2Wiso to hypointense with moderate diffusion restriction and STIR hyperintensity. Post contrast sequences show mildly heterogeneous enhancement of the lesion with few suspicious areas of necrosis. Small subtle areas of blooming appreciated in the MERGE sequences which may be related to recent procedure. This lesion is seen to involve the anterior 2/3rd of the tongue. In its lateral aspect, the lesion is seen to be in contact with the inner aspect of the mandibular alveolus of the left side molars. No obvious marrow signal alteration is appreciated and the correlative CT cuts taken did not show any obvious erosions in this region. Posteriorly, the lesion is seen to reach till just adjacent to the level of the retromolar trigone, however no obvious extension into the same is appreciated. In its medial aspect, the lesion is mostly confined to the lateral aspect of the transverse muscle and hyoglossus muscle with anterior extension to involve the sublingual gland with which the fat planes are indistinct. The lesion is seen to be confined to the left side at this level with no obvious extension to the midline. However, in its anterioinferior most aspect of the tongue, there is extension till the midline with minimal extension across the midline to the right side. These areas show subtle restricted diffusion and very minimal enhancement? significance/ ? edema related.

He underwent Left Subtotal Glossectomy + Access Mandibulotomy + Left Neck Dissection (levels I - IV) + ALT Free Flap + Tracheostomy on 24.01.2013 under GA. Postoperatively he had chest infection, Pulmonology consultation was sought and started on IV antibiotis (Inj. Magnex 2 gm Iv 1-0-1). Rest of the postoperative period was uneventful. Tracheostomy tube was deacnnulated on the fifth postoperative period. On the eight postoperative day he was started orally, but had small orocutaneous fistula-advised to continue Ryles tube feeding. Condition at discharge: Stable, afebrile, Ryles tube feeding, all sutures removed\nOPERATIVE FINDINGS : \n\nSurgery: Left Subtotal Glossectomy + Access Mandibulotomy + Left Neck Dissection (levels I - IV) + ALT Free Flap + Tracheostomy under GA on 24.01.2013 Procedure: Patient in supine position, under aseptic precautions with head turned towards right.Transvers neck incision with Midline Lip Split made, subplatysmal flaps raised. Access Mandibulotomy performed with pre plating, Subtotal Glossectomy performed which included the Left lateral tongue with the tumour and a clear margin around the tumour. Submental fibrofatty tissue dissected and displaced inferiorly. Facial artery and vein ligated and cut. Submandibular duct divided and ligated. Submandibualr fibrofatty tissue along with the submandibular gland dissected out. SCM dissected on its medial border to expose the Spinal accessory nerve, internal jugular vein and the carotid artery. Dissection continued inferiorly till omohyoid cross over separating the specimen from the IJV, carotid sheath, vagus and hypoglossal while proceeding medially. Specimen completely separted from the IJV and delivered. Hemostasis confirmed. Drain placed in situ.Anterolateral Thigh flap harvested from the left thigh, and microvascular anastamosis made with Left Facial Artery and Vein. Flap insetted into the defect and sutured.

MDCT neck was done on 15-05-2011, which showed large fungating necrotic mass involving the right infra temporal fossa, mandible, buccal mucosa and reaching upto the submandibular space and necrotic metastatic nodes at level right Ib and II. She was admitted and after preliminary investigations and evaluation she was taken up for surgery. She underwent wide local excision + Right modified radical neck dissection + Skin grafting + ALT flap reconstruction under GA on 2-06-2011. Postoperatively the flap got partially necrosed following infection. The wound was managed with daily dressings, subsequently she was taken up for skin grafting following debridement under GA on 30-06-2011. Postoperatively she had hematuria, Urology opinion was obtained and managed conservatively as per their advice. Rest of the postop period was uneventful. Her final histopathology report showed \"Lesion measures 6x5.3x3.5cms in maximum dimension- No lymphovascular emboli seen- Anterior, superior, posterior and inferior skin margins : Free - Shaved anterior, superior, posterior and inferior soft tissue margins : Free- Inked deep margin : Free- 2 right level V lymphnodes show metastasis, largest node measures 3 cms in maximum dimension.

MDCT neck and chest was done on 1-02-2011, which showed small enhancing growth along left lateral border of tongue. His case was discussed in Head and neck tumour board and it was decided to treat him with surgery. The patient was admitted and after all preliminary investigations and evaluation he was taken up for surgery. He underwent Wide local excision + Left neck dissection( level I-IV) + Radial forearm free flap reconstruction + Tracheostomy ( Head and Neck Major Resection , Reconstruction for cancer defect Grade II ) on 17-02-2011 under GA. Postoperatively he developed persistant hyponatermia, Nephrology consultation was sought and managed accordingly. On the sixth postoperative day tracheostomy tube was decannulated, but re insert the tube as he was not tolerated. He also developed both lower limb weakness, Neurology consulation sought and NCV done suggestive of diffuse sensory motor neuropathy secondary to diabetes and with possible contribution from chemotheraphy and critical illness neuropathy. Physiotherapy consultation was kept for the management of the same. Endocrinology consultation was sought for the management of high blood sugar. Based on the final histopathology report it was decided to treat him with adjuvant chemoradiation(Chemotheraphy deferred in view of comorbities and age). RT consultation deferred now due to poor genral condition.

He was initially kept in the ICU for monitoring. He was kept on anticoagulants and supportive medications. He was started on Ryle's tube feeds gradually and increased. He was also evaluated by Pulmonology post-operatively and given chest physiotherapy. He was extubated. Superficial necrosis of the flap was noted for which debridement was done, however the bulk of the flap was healthy. Right neck drain volume was persistently high and he was noted to have a fistula in the lower part of the suture line. The drain was removed and the Ryle's tube was reinserted for feeding. The wound is now healthy with minimal discharge from the fistula site. All sutures have been removed and he is fit for discharge.\nOPERATIVE FINDINGS : \n\nFindings: Tumour extent a the right buccal mucosa involved the buccinator and posteriorly the Lower ITF. Procedure: Under ET intubation, Patient in supine position. Painted and draped, Incision marked and infiltrated with lignocaine, Midline lip split made and right lower cheek flap raised. Wide excision Right sided tumour performed with the buccinator included as the lateral margin, the masseter was also included in the resection. Segmental Mandibulectomy performed between the level of sigmoid notch and medial to right canine tooth. A part of the Lingual nerve was included with the tumour specimen. Right selective neck dissection performed - horizontal Right Neck incision given and sub platysmal skin flaps raised and fixed with stay sutures. Clearance of level 1A done. Right Marginal mandibular nerve identified and dissected. Submandibular triangle clearance done after identifying facial vessels. Facial vessels dissected out from submandibular gland and preserved. Medial end of SCM identified and muscle separated exposing internal jugular vein. In level II spinal accessory nerve identified and separated. Level II B cleared. Next level IIA, III and IV cleared of lymph nodes and fibro fatty tissue. Hemostasis secured after Valsalva maneuver. Defect reconstructed with Right PMMC flap. skin paddle of 14x8 cms harvested and transferred into the defect and insetting doneinto the oral cavity. Chest wound closed in layers with drain in situ.

Left pectoralis major myocutaneous flap reconstruction under GA Dimensions: 10X4cms with skin . The clavicle, xiphoid, ipsilateral sternal border are identified, and then the size and location of the skin paddle being located at the inferior-medial border of the pectoralis major muscle are marked. The vascular axis is drawn on the skin of the chest. The initial incision is made at the lateral part toward the anterior axillary line down to the pectoralis major muscle. The inferior, medial and lateral incisions are made through the skin, subcutaneous fat and pectoralis fascia down to the chest wall. The superior incision is made down to the muscle fibres and the skin island is tightened to the muscle with sutures to protect the skin island during operative handling and shearing. As the muscle is elevated inferiorly to superiorly, the pedicle is identified by palpation and visualization on the deep surface of the muscle. While cutting the muscle along the sternal attachment, care was taken not to injury the internal mammary perforators adjacent to the sternum that supply the deltopectoral flap. After dissection of the flap off the chest wall, a subcutaneous tunnel is formed under the skin between neck and the chest and the flap is passed underneath the skin bridge and brought into neck. Flap inset done using 3-0 vicryl to the defect.\nADVICE ON DISCHARGE : \n\nKeep the wound dry and clean Oral care\nWHEN TO OBTAIN URGENT CARE: \n\nIn case of infection / bleeding / purulent discharge\nDIET RECOMMENDATIONS : \n\nSoft Oral Diet\nPHYSICAL ACTIVITY : \n\nAs tolerated\nDISCHARGE MEDICATION : \n\n*All current medication have been reviewed and reconciled into the medication list.
