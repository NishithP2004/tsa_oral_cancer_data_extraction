This patient is a 27-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on September 13, 2011. The initial tumor was classified as T4a, indicating extensive local invasion, and N1, indicating regional lymph node involvement. Following initial surgical resection, a selective neck dissection was performed. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a recurrence of nodal disease on January 11, 2012, classified as N3b, signifying significant regional spread. Subsequent pathological evaluation confirmed a T4a staging. Despite adjuvant therapy, the patient ultimately succumbed to the disease, with the last documented follow-up occurring on June 20, 2012. The surgery was performed bilaterally, and the case reflects a challenging presentation of oral squamous cell carcinoma with significant local and regional nodal involvement.
