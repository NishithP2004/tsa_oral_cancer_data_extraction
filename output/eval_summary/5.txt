The patient is a 31-year-old male who underwent surgery on 6/28/2018 for a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. The initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Pathology revealed a T4a tumor, indicating advanced local invasion, and subsequent pathological staging confirmed N2b and N3b nodal involvement. This aggressive presentation indicates the cancer had spread to regional lymph nodes. Despite the aggressive initial findings, the most recent follow-up on 12/15/2018 reported no evidence of disease, suggesting successful treatment and management to date. However, given the initial staging, continued surveillance is crucial to monitor for any potential recurrence.
