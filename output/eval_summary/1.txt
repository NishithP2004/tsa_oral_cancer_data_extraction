This patient is a 46-year-old male who underwent surgery on October 3, 2017, for a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located in the alveolus. The initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection, with initial findings indicating involvement of lymph nodes levels 1 through 4 (N1). Pathological examination confirmed a T4a staging, indicating advanced local disease with significant tumor size and potential for spread. Subsequently, the patient received adjuvant therapy. A follow-up on December 19, 2019, revealed no evidence of disease. The final pathological staging confirmed N2b nodal involvement. Despite this initial response, continued surveillance is crucial given the patientâ€™s initial T4a staging and N2b nodal involvement.
