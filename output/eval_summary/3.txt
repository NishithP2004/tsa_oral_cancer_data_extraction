This patient is a 58-year-old male who presented with a floor of mouth oral squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed on March 24, 2017. The initial tumor was classified as moderately differentiated and was surgically treated with a modified radical neck dissection. Pathology revealed a T4a staging at the time of initial surgery, indicating a large tumor with potential for local extension. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. However, the patient experienced local recurrence on February 15, 2021. At the time of last follow-up, on February 15, 2021, the disease was classified as N3b, indicating extensive nodal involvement, and the patient remained alive with disease. It's important to note that the timeline of events – initial diagnosis, recurrence, and last follow-up – occurred within a relatively short period, suggesting a potentially aggressive disease course.
