This 55-year-old male patient presented with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the floor of mouth. The tumor was initially diagnosed and surgically treated on March 13, 2018, involving a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Pathological examination revealed a T1 stage, indicating a small, localized primary tumor, and an N0 stage, signifying no detectable lymph node involvement. Consequently, no adjuvant therapy was administered. At the last follow-up on December 7, 2020, there was no evidence of disease recurrence.
