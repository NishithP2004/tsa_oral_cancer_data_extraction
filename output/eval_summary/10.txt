The patient is a 63-year-old male who underwent surgery on January 27, 2015, for a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. The initial surgical procedure involved a selective neck dissection, ultimately revealing a clinically and pathologically significant disease burden. Specifically, the pathology revealed a T4a tumor and clinically N1 nodal involvement, which was confirmed pathologically as N3b. Following surgery, the patient received adjuvant therapy. At the last follow-up on May 1, 2022, there was no evidence of disease. This indicates successful treatment and management of the oral cancer, despite the initially advanced stage.
