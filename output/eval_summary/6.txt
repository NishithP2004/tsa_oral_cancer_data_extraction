The patient was a 56-year-old male diagnosed with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, initially identified through surgical resection performed on February 7, 2018. The tumor was classified as T3 at the time of surgery, indicating an invasive tumor size. Subsequent pathological examination revealed an N1 nodal involvement, later upgraded to N3b, signifying significant spread to regional lymph nodes. Further pathological analysis confirmed a T4a classification, indicating a large tumor with potential invasion into deeper tissues. Following the initial surgery, the patient received adjuvant therapy. Unfortunately, despite these interventions, the patient succumbed to the disease, with the final follow-up occurring on August 28, 2018, confirming the presence of disease progression. The clinical and pathological findings consistently highlighted a locally aggressive tumor with substantial regional nodal involvement, ultimately leading to a poor prognosis.
