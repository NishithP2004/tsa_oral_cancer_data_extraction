This patient is a 66-year-old male who underwent surgery on March 6th, 2014, for a diagnosis of moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. The initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Pathological examination revealed a tumor classified as T3, indicating involvement of the deeper tissues, and N0, signifying no detectable lymph node involvement at the time of diagnosis. Following surgery, the patient did not receive adjuvant therapy. The last follow-up, conducted on July 13th, 2021, reported no evidence of disease. This suggests an initial successful treatment course, although long-term surveillance remains crucial to monitor for potential recurrence.
