The patient is a 83-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa. The tumor, diagnosed on November 9th, 2015, was classified as T4a, indicating a large and invasive primary tumor. Given this staging, a selective neck dissection was performed. Pathological examination revealed no nodal involvement (N0), and the tumor was classified as moderately differentiated. Despite this favorable nodal status, the patient underwent adjuvant therapy, though details are not specified in this summary. However, the patient ultimately succumbed to other causes following a last follow-up on January 9th, 2016.
