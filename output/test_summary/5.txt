The patient is a 30-year-old male who presented with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on 6/28/2018. Initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns about regional lymph node involvement. Pathological examination revealed a T4a tumor with associated N2b and N3b nodal involvement according to the 8th edition staging system. Subsequent follow-up on 8/31/2018 demonstrated no evidence of disease. The treatment strategy involved a comprehensive approach addressing the aggressive nature of the cancer and its extent.
