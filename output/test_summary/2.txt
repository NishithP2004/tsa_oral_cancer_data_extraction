This patient is a 61-year-old female who was diagnosed with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, initially identified on 10/24/2013. The tumor was classified as T1 (small primary tumor) based on clinical staging according to the 8th edition. Due to the presence of nodal involvement – specifically N2a status – a selective neck dissection was performed. Pathology revealed a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. A final follow-up examination on 5/15/2017 indicated no evidence of disease. The initial surgery was performed bilaterally, suggesting a location within the tongue. Importantly, this case demonstrates successful management through surgical intervention and adjuvant treatment, resulting in no evidence of recurrence at the last reported follow-up.
