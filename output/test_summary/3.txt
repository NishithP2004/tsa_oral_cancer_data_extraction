This male patient, age 58 at the time of his initial diagnosis, presented with a floor of mouth squamous cell carcinoma. The tumor was diagnosed on 3/27/2017 and was determined to be moderately differentiated. Initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) performed on 3/27/2017. Following the surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. Subsequent pathological examination revealed the tumor to be T4a, with N2a and N3b nodal involvement according to the 8th edition staging system. Despite these findings, the patient experienced a local recurrence on 8/17/2022. Continued follow-up, up to 2/24/2024, unfortunately revealed the patient succumbed to the disease while still under treatment. This case highlights the aggressive nature of the cancer and the challenges associated with achieving long-term control in patients with advanced nodal disease.
