This patient is a 63-year-old male who underwent surgery on January 27, 2015, for a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. The initial surgical approach involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Pathological examination revealed the tumor to be T3, indicating a significant local invasion, and demonstrated metastatic involvement of the neck nodes, classified as N2b and N3b according to the 8th edition staging system. Following the initial surgery and adjuvant therapy (details not provided in this summary), the patient was last followed up on June 15, 2021, with no evidence of disease. The summary reflects a complex case of oral cancer with initial local invasion and regional nodal involvement, ultimately achieving complete remission based on the last follow-up assessment.
