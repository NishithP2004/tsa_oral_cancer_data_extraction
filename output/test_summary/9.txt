This 68-year-old male patient presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on November 9th, 2015. The tumor was classified as T4a, indicating extensive local invasion and likely regional spread at the time of initial diagnosis. Subsequently, a selective neck dissection was performed, revealing no involved lymph nodes (N0). The patient underwent adjuvant therapy, though details are not specified. Despite initial staging, the patient progressed and was last followed up on October 1st, 2017, at which point he succumbed to the disease. This case represents a significant challenge in oral cancer management, highlighting the aggressive nature of the tumor and the potential for disease progression despite initial surgical intervention and a negative lymph node status.
