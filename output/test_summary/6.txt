This 56-year-old male patient presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa, diagnosed on February 7, 2018. Initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4), revealing metastatic disease extending to the neck (N2c stage). Subsequent pathological examination confirmed a T4a tumor and a final pathological N staging of N3b, indicating extensive spread. Following surgery, the patient received adjuvant therapy. At his last follow-up on August 6, 2018, the patient remained alive but was found to be persistently alive with disease. The tumor remained localized to the buccal mucosa, with confirmed regional lymph node involvement.
