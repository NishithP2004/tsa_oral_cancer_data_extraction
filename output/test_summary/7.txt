This patient is a 28-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on November 9, 2011. The initial pathology revealed a T4a and N2b/N3b staging according to the 8th edition of the clinical tumor staging system, indicating an aggressive local tumor with significant nodal involvement. A selective neck dissection was performed as part of the initial surgical treatment. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was administered. The patient's last follow-up was on February 9, 2012, at which point he was unfortunately reported as being ‘Died With Disease.’ This indicates that the cancer had progressed despite treatment and ultimately led to his demise.
