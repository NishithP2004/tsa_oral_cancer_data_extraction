This 46-year-old male patient presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma arising from the alveolus of the lower lip. The tumor, diagnosed on October 3, 2017, was classified as T4a, indicating a large tumor with invasion into deep structures. Due to the extent of the disease, a selective neck dissection was performed. Pathological examination revealed nodal involvement (N3b) requiring extensive lymph node management. Following surgery and adjuvant therapy, the patient remained disease-free at the last follow-up on November 12, 2022, with no evidence of recurrent disease.
