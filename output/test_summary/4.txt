This 54-year-old male patient presented with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the alveolus, diagnosed on 3/12/2018. The tumor was classified as T2 based on clinical staging according to the 8th edition, indicating a locally advanced tumor. Surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection (1-4 levels), followed by pathological confirmation of N0 nodal involvement. Subsequent follow-up on 8/6/2024 revealed no evidence of disease. The initial surgical approach, combined with a negative nodal assessment, suggests a localized presentation of the carcinoma.
