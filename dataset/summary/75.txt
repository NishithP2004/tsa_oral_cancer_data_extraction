This patient is a 62-year-old male who presented with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa. The initial surgical resection, performed on August 6, 2019, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Pathological examination revealed an N0 nodal status. The tumor was staged clinically as T4a. Following initial surgery, the patient experienced local recurrence of the oral cancer. Subsequent follow-up, concluded on June 13, 2020, did not reveal any evidence of disease progression or metastasis. The case demonstrates a challenging presentation of oral squamous cell carcinoma with initial local aggressive behavior requiring extensive surgical intervention, followed by a period of stability during the last follow-up.
