The patient is a 56-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on February 7, 2018. Initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) performed at the time of diagnosis. Pathology revealed a T3 tumor. Subsequent pathological examination following the initial surgery indicated N3b nodal involvement. The tumor was classified as T4a due to its extent. Following the initial surgical treatment and confirmed nodal involvement, the patient underwent adjuvant therapy. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the oral cancer. Subsequently, the patient developed nodal recurrence as well. Despite adjuvant treatment, the patient ultimately succumbed to the disease, with the final follow-up recorded as August 28, 2018. The bilateral surgery was performed. The final status at the time of death was documented as ‘Died With Disease’.
