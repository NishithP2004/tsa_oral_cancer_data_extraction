This patient is a 49-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa. The initial surgical intervention, performed on September 25, 2018, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns about nodal involvement. Pathology revealed a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Subsequent pathological review indicated no nodal involvement (N0) despite the initial surgical procedure. The tumor was staged as T1. Following surgery, there was a documented local recurrence, with the date of recurrence unspecified in the provided records. Furthermore, there was documented nodal recurrence, though the exact date is not specified. The last follow-up was conducted on November 24, 2018, at which time there was no evidence of disease. The surgery was performed bilaterally. While the initial surgery involved a wider neck dissection (levels 1-4), the final pathological assessment confirmed no nodal involvement at the time of the initial resection.
