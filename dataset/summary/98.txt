This patient is a 56-year-old female diagnosed with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa, initially detected on 6/4/2013. The tumor was staged as T2 at the time of initial surgery, which included a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Following the initial surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. However, the patient experienced local recurrence on 8/12/2013, with subsequent nodal recurrence classified as N3b according to the 8th edition staging system. This indicated extensive disease spread. Despite the initial surgery and adjuvant treatment, the patient ultimately succumbed to the disease, confirmed at her last follow-up on 9/16/2013. The tumor exhibited a T4a classification, indicating a large tumor size with potential invasion into deeper tissues and likely regional extension. The case represents a significant challenge in oral cancer management, highlighting the potential for local recurrence and metastatic spread even with aggressive surgical intervention and adjuvant therapies.
