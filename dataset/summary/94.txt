This patient is a 42-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on March 22, 2012. The initial tumor was classified as T2 based on clinical staging according to the 8th Edition. Following surgical resection involving a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4), the patient experienced local recurrence. Subsequent nodal recurrence was also identified. Pathological examination revealed an N2b nodal staging and a T3 pathological tumor classification according to the 8th edition. Adjuvant therapy was administered. The final follow-up, conducted on June 20, 2012, indicated no evidence of disease. The surgery was performed on the ipsilateral side. This case represents a challenging scenario of oral cancer with local recurrence and nodal involvement, ultimately demonstrating no evidence of disease at the time of last follow-up.
