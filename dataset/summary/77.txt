This patient is a 60-year-old female diagnosed with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the alveolus located in the lower lip (ipsilateral). The initial diagnosis, made on January 25, 2017, revealed a T4a tumor, indicating extensive local involvement. Complete surgical resection was performed with a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4), resulting in an N0 nodal status. Pathology confirmed a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was not administered. However, the patient experienced local recurrence, followed by nodal recurrence. Despite these developments, the patient ultimately succumbed to other causes, representing the final state at last follow-up.
