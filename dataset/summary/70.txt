This patient is a 75-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the lips, diagnosed on 6/4/2015. The initial tumor was classified as T4a, indicating extensive local involvement, and was treated with a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Pathological examination revealed no nodal involvement (N0) despite the T4a classification, which is notable. Following surgery, the patient received adjuvant therapy. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the oral cancer. Subsequently, he also developed nodal recurrence, classified as N1. Despite this, a final follow-up on 12/9/2019 revealed no evidence of disease. The surgery was performed bilaterally.
