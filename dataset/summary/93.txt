This 57-year-old female patient presented with oral cancer, diagnosed through a pathology report revealing a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. Initial surgical intervention, performed on August 7, 2018, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns about potential nodal involvement. Pathology confirmed the tumor as N0 (no lymph node involvement) according to the 8th edition staging system and T3 (tumor size greater than 5cm or involving deep mylofibrous layer) based on the initial surgical findings. Following the initial surgery, the patient experienced a local recurrence. Subsequently, she also experienced nodal recurrence, documented in the patientâ€™s records. The last follow-up was recorded as October 17, 2018, at which time there was no evidence of disease. The surgical procedure was performed on the ipsilateral side of the tongue.
