This patient is a 59-year-old female who presented with well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa, initially diagnosed and surgically treated on June 2nd, 2011. The tumor was staged as T4a and N2b according to the 8th Edition clinical staging system, reflecting a locally advanced disease with nodal involvement. A modified radical neck dissection was performed at the time of initial surgery. Following this, adjuvant therapy was not administered. The tumor recurred locally, and subsequently nodal recurrence was observed. The patient's last follow-up was on September 17th, 2011, at which point there was no evidence of disease. The surgery was performed on the ipsilateral side.
