This 52-year-old male patient presented with oral cancer, initially diagnosed as a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. Following surgical resection on February 27, 2018, a selective neck dissection was performed, revealing nodal involvement categorized as N2c (status undefined) and N3b, indicating significant disease spread. The tumor was staged clinically as T3, reflecting its size and extent. Post-surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence, followed by nodal recurrence. Despite treatment, the patient succumbed to the disease. The final follow-up was recorded as December 9, 2018.
