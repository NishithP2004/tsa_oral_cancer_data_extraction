This patient is a 42-year-old female who presented with oral cancer, diagnosed as a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. The initial surgery, performed on February 28, 2017, involved selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Pathology revealed a T2 stage tumor. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. Subsequently, the patient experienced local recurrence of the tumor, with nodal recurrence occurring as well. The final follow-up, as of December 28, 2020, indicated no evidence of disease. The tumor exhibited a T4a pathological stage, suggesting extensive involvement at the time of initial diagnosis. Despite the initial surgery and adjuvant treatment, the tumor demonstrated aggressive behavior and ultimately required additional intervention due to local recurrence.
