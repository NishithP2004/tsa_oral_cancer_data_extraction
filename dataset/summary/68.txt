The patient is a 59-year-old male who presented with a floor of mouth oral squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed on 9/1/2016. The initial tumor was classified as moderately differentiated and staged as T4a, indicating a large tumor with potential for local extension and nodal involvement. Following initial surgical resection involving a selective neck dissection (1-4 levels), the patient experienced a local recurrence on 5/25/2019. Subsequent pathological examination revealed no nodal involvement (N0) despite the local recurrence, classifying the nodal status as N0. The patient's last follow-up was also 5/25/2019, and he remains alive with disease. This case represents a challenging scenario of initial T4a oral cancer with local recurrence and no identified nodal metastasis at the time of last follow-up.
