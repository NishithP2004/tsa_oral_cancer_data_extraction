This 48-year-old female patient presented with oral cancer, specifically a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, located on the tongue. The initial surgical intervention, performed on January 4th, 2021, involved selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns about potential nodal involvement. Pathological examination revealed a T2 tumor and, critically, no nodal metastases (N0). However, subsequent pathological findings indicated local recurrence, with documented nodal recurrence (N2b). Despite the initial N0 status, the patient subsequently experienced progression to N2b nodal involvement. The last follow-up was conducted on August 12th, 2021, and at that time, there was no evidence of disease. The surgery was performed bilaterally.
