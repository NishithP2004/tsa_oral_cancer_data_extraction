This 47-year-old male presented with oral cancer originating on the tongue. Initial surgical intervention, performed on February 22, 2022, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns regarding nodal involvement. Pathology revealed a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Subsequent pathological examination confirmed significant nodal involvement, classified as N3b according to the 8th Edition clinical tumor staging system. The tumor was classified as T4a, indicating a large tumor size with invasion into deep structures. Following the initial surgery, the patient experienced a local recurrence. Further pathological evaluation confirmed nodal recurrence as well. The last documented follow-up was on July 31, 2021, at which point there was no evidence of disease. It's important to note that the specific dates of nodal and local recurrence are not provided in the available information.
