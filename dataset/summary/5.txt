This patient is a 41-year-old male who presented with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on May 28, 2016. The initial surgical intervention involved a modified radical neck dissection, revealing extensive nodal involvement categorized as N3b according to the 8th edition staging system. This indicated a significant spread of the disease to the neck lymph nodes. Pathology confirmed the tumor was poorly differentiated and T3 in size. Following the initial surgery, adjuvant therapy was not administered. Subsequently, the patient experienced local recurrence, with the date of recurrence not specified in the provided records. Further, the patient developed nodal recurrence. The last follow-up was recorded as January 17, 2019, at which point the patient was unfortunately found to be deceased with disease. The case represents a challenging instance of oral cancer progression, characterized by initial local aggressive tumor behavior and extensive nodal metastasis necessitating a modified radical neck dissection, ultimately leading to a poor prognosis.
