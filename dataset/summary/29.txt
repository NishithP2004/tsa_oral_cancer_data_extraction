This patient is a 35-year-old male who presented with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on July 20, 2015. The initial tumor was classified as T4a, indicating extensive local invasion, and was treated with a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Pathologically, the nodal status was initially N0, signifying no detectable nodal involvement at the time of initial surgery. Following this, the patient experienced a local recurrence. Subsequently, he also developed nodal recurrence, as determined by pathological examination. The final follow-up was conducted on November 2, 2019, at which point there was no evidence of disease. The surgery was performed bilaterally. The case represents a challenging situation of oral squamous cell carcinoma with significant local invasion and subsequent recurrence, highlighting the need for aggressive treatment and diligent long-term surveillance.
