This patient is a 48-year-old female who presented with oral cancer originating on the tongue. Initial surgical intervention, a modified radical neck dissection, was performed on November 16, 2015, revealing a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, classified as T3 at the time of surgery. Following this initial surgery, the cancer demonstrated local recurrence. Subsequent pathological examination revealed bilateral nodal involvement, classified as N1, and ultimately progressed to N2a. The tumor was classified as T4a. Despite adjuvant therapy, the patient experienced further disease progression. The last follow-up was conducted on February 2, 2019, at which point there was no evidence of disease. This case highlights a challenging course of moderately differentiated oral squamous cell carcinoma with significant nodal involvement and subsequent recurrence, despite adjuvant treatment.
