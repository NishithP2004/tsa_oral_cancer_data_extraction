The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the lips, diagnosed on December 3rd, 2013. Initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns about nodal involvement. Pathological examination revealed a T4a tumor and, crucially, N0 nodal status. Despite the N0 findings, the patient experienced local recurrence of the cancer. Subsequently, he underwent a second surgery, with bilateral neck dissection performed. The final pathological assessment confirmed a T4a staging, and while the initial N0 staging was upheld, the final nodal status was reported as N2b. The patient was last followed up on September 28th, 2015, with no evidence of disease present at that time. This case demonstrates a complex progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma, initially presenting with a high-grade tumor but with an absence of detectable nodal involvement at the time of initial diagnosis, subsequently developing into a more aggressive, bilaterally disseminated disease.
