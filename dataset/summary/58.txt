This patient is a 71-year-old male who presented with oral cancer, diagnosed as a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the floor of the mouth. The initial surgery, performed on August 7, 2015, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Pathological examination revealed a T2 tumor stage, indicating a tumor greater than 2 cm in greatest dimension but no more than 4 cm, and a clinically N0 status, meaning no regional lymph node metastases were identified at the time of initial surgery. However, the patient experienced a local recurrence, with the date of recurrence unspecified in the available records. Subsequently, the patient developed nodal recurrence, again with an undefined date. Despite the initial surgical intervention and adjuvant therapy (details of which are not provided), the patient's condition progressed to include both local and nodal disease. The last follow-up was conducted on August 12, 2016, at which point there was no evidence of disease. The surgical procedures were performed bilaterally.
