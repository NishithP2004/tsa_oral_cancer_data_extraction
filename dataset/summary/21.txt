This patient is a 46-year-old male who presented with oral cancer, specifically a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, located on the tongue. The initial surgery, performed on October 27, 2015, involved selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns about potential nodal involvement. Pathology revealed a T3 tumor, indicating extensive local invasion. Importantly, the initial pathology reported no nodal involvement (N0). Following this initial surgery, the patient received adjuvant therapy. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the oral cancer. Subsequently, he also experienced nodal recurrence, necessitating further investigation. The last follow-up was conducted on June 18, 2016, and at that time, there was no evidence of disease detected. The bilateral neck dissection was performed as part of the management of the nodal recurrence.
