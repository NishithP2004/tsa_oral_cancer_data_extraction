This patient is a 49-year-old male who presented with oral cancer, diagnosed through pathology revealing a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. The initial surgery, performed on March 20, 2017, involved selective neck dissection (levels 1-4), indicating involvement of regional lymph nodes. The tumor was staged as T2, reflecting its size, and N1, signifying involvement of one to three regional lymph nodes. Following surgery, the patient received no adjuvant therapy. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the tumor. Subsequently, nodal recurrence was observed. The last follow-up was recorded as May 20, 2017, at which point there was no evidence of disease. This case highlights the aggressive potential of the tumor and the importance of close follow-up for patients with this type of oral cancer.
