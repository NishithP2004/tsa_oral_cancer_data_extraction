This 61-year-old male patient presented with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma arising from the buccal mucosa. The initial surgical intervention, performed on April 23, 2020, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns regarding potential nodal involvement. Subsequent pathological examination revealed a T2 tumor and an N0 nodal status, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis at the time of initial surgery. Despite this initial favorable pathological assessment, the patient experienced a local recurrence. Further investigation revealed nodal recurrence, with documented involvement of the neck nodes. The final follow-up was conducted on October 1, 2020, with no evidence of disease detected at that time. The initial surgery was performed bilaterally.
