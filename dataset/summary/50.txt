This patient is a 70-year-old female who presented with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma originating in the tongue. The tumor was initially diagnosed and surgically removed on October 24, 2017, with a selective neck dissection revealing involvement of lymph nodes (N2b). Following the initial surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the tumor. Subsequently, pathological examination revealed nodal involvement classified as N3b. Despite treatment, the patient succumbed to other causes on her last follow-up date of July 13, 2018. The tumor was bilaterally located. The original tumor was classified as T4a, indicating a significant extent of local invasion. This case highlights the aggressive nature of the disease and the challenges in achieving long-term control, even with aggressive surgical and adjuvant treatment.
