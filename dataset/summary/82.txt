This patient is a 34-year-old male who presented with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on July 9th, 2013. The initial tumor was classified as T2, indicating a local invasion. Following surgical intervention, including a selective neck dissection (1-4), the patient underwent adjuvant therapy. Pathology revealed an N0 nodal stage, meaning no cancerous lymph nodes were identified during the initial dissection. However, the patient experienced a local recurrence, with the date of recurrence noted. Subsequently, nodal recurrence was also identified. The final follow-up was recorded as March 22nd, 2014, at which point there was no evidence of disease. The surgery was performed on the ipsilateral side of the tongue.
