This patient is a 40-year-old female who presented with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa. The initial surgery, performed on 2/1/2011, revealed a T4a and N3b staging, necessitating a selective neck dissection. Following this, the patient experienced local recurrence on 3/23/2011. Despite adjuvant therapy not being administered, the disease progressed, leading to further nodal recurrence. Unfortunately, the patient ultimately succumbed to the disease while it was already disseminated. The final follow-up was recorded on 8/3/2014. The case highlights the aggressive nature of the buccal mucosa carcinoma and underscores the importance of meticulous surgical staging and consideration for adjuvant treatment in such instances.
