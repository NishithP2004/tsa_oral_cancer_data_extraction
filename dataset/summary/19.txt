This patient is a 45-year-old female who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on February 13, 2020. The initial tumor was classified as T4a, indicating extensive local invasion, and N3b, signifying metastasis to level III regional lymph nodes. Consequently, a selective neck dissection was performed. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the oral cancer. Subsequently, nodal recurrence was also observed. Despite these challenges, the final follow-up on March 28, 2020, revealed no evidence of disease, suggesting an initial successful response to treatment, though continued surveillance would be warranted due to the aggressive nature of the initial tumor and the N3b nodal status.
