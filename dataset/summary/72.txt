This patient is a 63-year-old male who underwent surgery on October 28, 2014, for a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. The initial tumor was classified as T4a, indicating a large tumor with potential invasion into deeper structures. Following the initial surgery, a selective neck dissection was performed (levels 1-4). Pathological examination revealed no nodal involvement at the time of the initial surgery, classifying the nodes as N0. However, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the oral cancer. Subsequently, he developed nodal recurrence, although the precise timeline of these events is not specified in this summary. The last follow-up was conducted on May 5, 2021, and at that time, there was no evidence of disease. The surgical approach was bilateral, suggesting a comprehensive treatment strategy. This case represents a complex scenario of oral cancer progression, highlighting the importance of vigilant surveillance and potential for both local and nodal recurrence, even with initial N0 nodal status.
