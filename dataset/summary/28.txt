This patient is a 61-year-old female who presented with oral cancer, diagnosed as a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, originating on the tongue. The initial surgery, performed on October 24, 2013, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns about regional spread. Pathology revealed a T2 tumor, indicating a larger size and potential invasion into deeper tissues, alongside a nodal involvement classified as N2c, signifying a significant spread to regional lymph nodes. Following the initial surgery, adjuvant therapy was administered. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the cancer, with subsequent nodal recurrence detected. The final follow-up was conducted on November 1, 2017, at which point there was no evidence of disease. The case demonstrates the aggressive nature of the cancer and highlights the importance of aggressive surgical intervention and adjuvant therapy, as well as close surveillance for recurrence in patients with N2c nodal involvement.
