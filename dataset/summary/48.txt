This patient is a 53-year-old female who presented with oral cancer, specifically a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. The initial surgical intervention, performed on March 1st, 2016, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns regarding potential metastasis. Pathology revealed a T4a tumor, indicating a large tumor with potential invasion into deeper tissues and/or adjacent structures. Critically, the initial pathology revealed no nodal involvement (N0). However, the patient experienced a local recurrence. Subsequent follow-up revealed nodal involvement (N2b) at the time of recurrence. Despite the initial broad surgical approach, the tumor demonstrated a propensity for local spread and subsequent regional metastasis. The final follow-up was conducted on October 11th, 2016, at which point there was no evidence of disease. This case highlights the aggressive nature of the oral squamous cell carcinoma, requiring extensive initial surgical management and vigilant long-term monitoring due to the potential for recurrence and nodal spread.
