This 46-year-old male patient presented with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma originating in the alveolus of the lower lip. The initial surgery, performed on October 3, 2017, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns about metastasis. Pathology revealed a T4a tumor, indicating extensive local invasion. Subsequent pathological examination confirmed N2b nodal involvement, signifying spread to multiple lymph nodes. Following the initial surgery and adjuvant therapy (details not specified), the patient experienced a local recurrence. Subsequently, nodal recurrence was also observed. The last follow-up was conducted on December 19, 2019, at which time there was no evidence of disease. The surgery was performed bilaterally.
