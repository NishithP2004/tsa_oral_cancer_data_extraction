This 55-year-old male patient presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma originating in the retromolar trigone. The initial surgical resection, performed on April 23, 2020, involved a modified radical neck dissection. Pathology revealed a T4a staging, indicating extensive local involvement, and an N3b nodal status, signifying significant spread to regional lymph nodes. Following the initial surgery, the patient experienced local recurrence on September 30, 2020. Despite adjuvant therapy, the disease progressed. Unfortunately, the patient succumbed to the disease with metastatic disease, as confirmed at his last follow-up on October 18, 2020. The final pathological staging confirmed T4a and N3b, indicating a highly aggressive and extensive disease course.‚Äù} 5/10/2023
