This patient is a 79-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on 11/18/2018. The initial tumor was staged as T3, indicating a significant size and/or local invasion. Due to the involvement, a selective neck dissection was performed. Pathology revealed an N1 nodal involvement, confirming the extent of the disease. Following initial surgery and subsequent pathological findings, the patient received adjuvant therapy. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the oral cancer. Subsequently, nodal recurrence was also observed. Despite the aggressive nature of the disease and the recurrence, the patientâ€™s last follow-up on 6/25/2019 reported no evidence of disease. The case highlights the challenges of managing locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinomas, particularly in older individuals, and the importance of vigilant surveillance following initial treatment.
