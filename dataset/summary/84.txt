The patient is a 47-year-old male who presented with a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on May 20, 2016. The initial tumor was classified as T2, indicating a local invasion of approximately 2-4 cm. Due to the involvement of regional lymph nodes, a selective neck dissection was performed, revealing N3b nodal involvement. Pathology confirmed a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was not administered. Subsequently, the patient experienced local recurrence of the oral cancer. Further investigation revealed nodal recurrence as well. The last follow-up was conducted on December 7, 2016, and at that time, no evidence of disease was noted, despite the prior local and nodal recurrence.
