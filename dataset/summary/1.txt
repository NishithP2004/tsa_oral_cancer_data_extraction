The patient is a 40-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma arising from the buccal mucosa. The initial surgery, performed on June 21, 2018, was a radical neck dissection, indicating an aggressive local disease process. Pathology revealed a T4a and N3b staging according to the 8th edition of the clinical tumor staging system. This signifies a large primary tumor and significant nodal involvement, specifically bilateral nodal metastases extending to the neck. Subsequently, the patient underwent adjuvant therapy, although the specific details were not reported. Sadly, the patient experienced local recurrence, followed by nodal recurrence. The final follow-up was conducted on August 27, 2018, at which point the patient was unfortunately found to be deceased with disease. This case represents a particularly challenging instance of oral cancer characterized by extensive local and nodal spread, ultimately resulting in a fatal outcome.
