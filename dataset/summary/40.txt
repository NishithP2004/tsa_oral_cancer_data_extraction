The patient is a 67-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the hard palate, diagnosed on March 1, 2016. The initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns about potential nodal involvement. Pathological examination confirmed a T4a tumor staging and N2c nodal staging, indicating extensive local disease and significant nodal spread. Subsequent pathological review confirmed the diagnosis of moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Following the initial surgery, the patient experienced a local recurrence and nodal recurrence. Despite the aggressive nature of the disease and its extensive stage (T4a, N2c), the patient underwent bilateral neck dissection. Sadly, the patient ultimately succumbed to the disease, with the final follow-up occurring on April 27, 2018. The case represents a challenging situation of advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma with significant nodal involvement, highlighting the complexities of treatment and prognosis in such cases.
