This patient is a 40-year-old male who presented with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on October 7, 2013. The initial tumor was classified as T2, indicating a localized extent. Following surgical intervention, including a selective neck dissection (1-4 levels), the patient underwent pathological examination revealing no nodal involvement (N0). However, the patient experienced local recurrence, documented on [Date of Local Recurrence - needs extraction from records]. Subsequently, nodal recurrence was also observed ([Date of Nodal recurrence - needs extraction from records]). Despite the initial N0 staging, the disease progression necessitated further treatment. The last documented follow-up was on January 24, 2014, at which time there was no evidence of disease. The surgery was performed on the ipsilateral side. The tumor was staged as N0 and T3 at the time of initial diagnosis. The final follow-up indicates no evidence of disease at that point.
