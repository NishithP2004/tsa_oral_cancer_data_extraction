This patient is a 60-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on March 27, 2012. The initial tumor was classified as T4a, indicating a large tumor with potential for local extension and involvement of deeper structures. Following surgical resection, a selective neck dissection was performed (levels 1-4). Pathological examination revealed an N0 nodal status, signifying no detectable cancer spread to regional lymph nodes at the time of initial surgery. The patient subsequently experienced a local recurrence, and then nodal recurrence. Despite adjuvant therapy, the patient ultimately succumbed to other causes on 12/29/2016. The surgical procedure was performed bilaterally.
