The patient is a 61-year-old male who presented with oral cancer, specifically a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, located on the buccal mucosa. The initial surgery, performed on November 22, 2016, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns regarding nodal involvement. Pathological examination revealed a T4a tumor and N1 nodal involvement. Following this initial surgery, adjuvant therapy was administered. Unfortunately, the patient experienced local recurrence of the cancer. Subsequent follow-up, concluded on August 3, 2017, indicated no evidence of disease at that time. However, the complete clinical course remains incomplete as the dates of nodal recurrence and final follow-up are unspecified.
