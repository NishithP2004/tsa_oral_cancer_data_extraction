This patient is a 53-year-old male who presented with oral cancer, specifically a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, located on the tongue. The initial surgery, performed on June 30, 2015, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concern for potential metastasis. Pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a T2 tumor and an N0 nodal status â€“ meaning no cancerous lymph nodes were identified during the initial dissection. Following this surgery, the patient received no adjuvant therapy. Unfortunately, the cancer recurred locally, and subsequently, nodal recurrence was observed. The last follow-up was conducted on August 5, 2015, at which point there was no evidence of further disease progression. This case represents a challenging situation with initial surgical resection followed by local recurrence and nodal involvement, but crucially, no evidence of distant metastasis at the time of last follow-up.
