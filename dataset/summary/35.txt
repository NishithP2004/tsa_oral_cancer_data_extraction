This 72-year-old male patient presented with a floor of mouth oral squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed on 10/7/2015. The tumor was classified as moderately differentiated and was staged clinically as T4a, indicating extensive local invasion. Given the clinical staging, a selective neck dissection was performed. Pathological examination revealed no nodal involvement (N0) despite the T4a classification. Following surgery, the patient received no adjuvant therapy. However, the cancer recurred locally and subsequently spread to the regional lymph nodes, classified as N1. The final follow-up was recorded on 10/20/2015, at which point the patient’s condition was documented as ‘died with disease.’
