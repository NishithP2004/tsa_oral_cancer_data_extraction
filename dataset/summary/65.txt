This patient is a 68-year-old male who presented with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma originating in the alveolus of his mouth. The initial surgery, performed on December 19, 2017, involved a selective neck dissection (1-4 levels) due to concerns about potential nodal involvement. Pathology revealed a T4a tumor, indicating extensive local invasion. Despite initial surgical resection, the patient experienced a local recurrence. Subsequently, a bilateral neck dissection was performed, with pathological nodal staging revealing N2c involvement. Importantly, the initial pathology reported N0 nodal involvement. The patient's condition progressed to include disease with the patient's death, last followed up on May 19, 2020.
