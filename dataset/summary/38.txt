This patient is a 27-year-old female diagnosed with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, initially identified on October 18, 2016. The tumor was classified as T4a, indicating a large tumor with evidence of invasion into deep structures, and N2c, signifying the involvement of the neck with metastasis to level III lymph nodes. Following initial surgical resection, a selective neck dissection was performed. Due to local recurrence, a second surgery was necessitated. The patient underwent bilateral neck dissection to address the nodal recurrence. Despite this intervention, the patient's last follow-up on March 20, 2017, revealed no evidence of disease. The tumor's initial characteristics, a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, reflect a significant aggressive potential, as indicated by the advanced staging and subsequent need for multiple surgical interventions.
