This patient is a 59-year-old male who presented with a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on August 31, 2017. The initial tumor was classified as T3, indicating an invasive tumor with extension into deeper tissues. Following surgical resection, a selective neck dissection was performed (levels 1-4), and the patient received adjuvant therapy. Pathological examination revealed nodal involvement (N1) and extended nodal disease (N2c), indicating metastasis to regional lymph nodes. Despite these findings, the patient was last followed up on December 6, 2019, with no evidence of disease. The surgery was performed bilaterally. This case represents a challenging scenario of oral cancer with significant nodal involvement, but ultimately demonstrates a successful outcome with adjuvant therapy and close follow-up.
