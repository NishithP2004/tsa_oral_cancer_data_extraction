This patient is a 27-year-old male who presented with an aggressively progressing oral cancer originating on the tongue. Initial surgical intervention, performed on September 13, 2011, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns about lymph node involvement. Pathology revealed a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Following the initial surgery, the patient experienced local recurrence on January 11, 2012, along with nodal recurrence, classified as N1 and N3b according to the 8th Edition clinical staging system. Subsequent follow-up until June 20, 2012, indicated disease progression, ultimately resulting in the patient's death with disease. Bilateral neck dissection was performed. The tumor was classified as T4a, indicating a large primary tumor. The case represents a significant challenge in head and neck oncology, demonstrating the potential for rapid progression and the need for aggressive treatment strategies in advanced oral cancer.
