This patient is a 40-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on May 17, 2011. The initial tumor was classified as T3, indicating a locally advanced disease. Following surgical resection involving a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4), the patient was treated with adjuvant therapy. Pathological examination revealed no nodal involvement (N0). However, the patient experienced a local recurrence, with the date of recurrence not specified in the provided information. Subsequently, there was also nodal recurrence. The final follow-up was conducted on June 24, 2019, at which point no evidence of disease was reported. Bilateral neck dissection was performed. The case highlights a challenging scenario of oral squamous cell carcinoma with initial local progression, requiring aggressive surgical management and adjuvant therapy, ultimately resulting in a seemingly successful outcome at last follow-up.
