This patient is a 48-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma originating in the buccal mucosa. The tumor was initially diagnosed and surgically treated on 2/2/2017. The initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection, revealing nodal involvement classified as N2a, indicating spread to the level of the neck. Following this initial surgery, the patient received adjuvant therapy. Unfortunately, the cancer recurred locally, with a confirmed date of local recurrence. Subsequently, nodal recurrence was also documented. Despite adjuvant treatment, the patient ultimately succumbed to the disease, with the last documented follow-up occurring on 6/16/2017. The final pathological staging according to the 8th edition categorized the tumor as T4a, indicating a large primary tumor, and N2b, indicating significant nodal involvement. The disease progression reflects a challenging case of oral squamous cell carcinoma with substantial local and nodal extension, ultimately leading to an unfavorable outcome.
