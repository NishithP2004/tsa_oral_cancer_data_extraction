This patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on June 14, 2018. The initial tumor was classified as T4a, indicating extensive local invasion, and N2c nodal involvement, signifying spread to the neck. Consequently, a selective neck dissection was performed. Following the initial surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the oral cancer, followed by nodal recurrence. Despite treatment, the patient ultimately succumbed to the disease, documented as ‘died with disease’ at last follow-up on December 7, 2020. The final pathological staging, according to the 8th edition, confirmed the aggressive nature of the disease with a T4a pathological T stage and a N3b pathological N stage. Bilateral neck dissection was performed.
