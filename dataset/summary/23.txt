This patient is a 60-year-old female who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on December 30, 2019. The tumor was staged clinically as T4a, indicating a large primary tumor with potential for local invasion. Due to the extent of the disease, a selective neck dissection was performed. Pathological examination revealed no nodal involvement (N0). Following surgery, the patient received adjuvant therapy. Unfortunately, the patient experienced local recurrence of the oral cancer. Subsequent investigation revealed nodal recurrence as well. Despite continued follow-up to July 28, 2021, no evidence of disease was observed. The case represents a challenging scenario of advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma, highlighting the importance of aggressive local treatment and careful long-term monitoring.
