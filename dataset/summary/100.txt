This patient is a 60-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on July 4, 2016. The initial tumor was classified as T4b, indicating a large tumor with potential invasion into deeper structures, and N2a, signifying involvement of two or more level I or II lymph nodes. Following initial surgical resection involving a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4), the patient experienced local recurrence on October 1, 2016. Despite this, the primary tumor remained at a T4b stage. Unfortunately, the patient ultimately succumbed to the disease, with the final follow-up occurring on November 23, 2016. The details regarding nodal recurrence are incomplete, noting ‘no nodes undefined.’
