This patient is a 67-year-old male who presented with oral cancer, diagnosed with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. The initial surgery, performed on March 20, 2012, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4), indicating a concern for potential nodal involvement. Pathology revealed a T4a tumor staging, signifying advanced local disease. Crucially, the pathology was N0, indicating no nodal involvement at the time of initial diagnosis. Following this initial surgery, adjuvant therapy was administered. However, the patient experienced a local recurrence, documented on [Date of Local Recurrence - needs to be filled in]. Subsequently, further nodal recurrence was observed ([Date of Nodal recurrence - needs to be filled in]). The last follow-up examination was conducted on March 8, 2021, with no evidence of disease detected at that time. The surgery was performed bilaterally. Overall, this case represents a complex progression of oral cancer with initial local spread, followed by nodal dissemination, and ultimately, a period of apparent stability prior to the last documented follow-up. Further investigation and continued monitoring would be essential.
