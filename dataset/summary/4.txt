This 63-year-old male patient presented with a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma originating in the retromolar trigone. The tumor was initially diagnosed and surgically removed on May 6th, 2014, utilizing a radical neck dissection, indicating a high-risk presentation. Pathological staging at the time of surgery was T4a and N0. Following the initial surgery, the patient underwent adjuvant therapy. However, the patient experienced local recurrence of the cancer, documented on June 6th, 2014. Subsequently, nodal recurrence was also observed. Despite this progression, the last follow-up indicated no evidence of disease at that time. The case highlights a challenging presentation with initial aggressive local spread necessitating aggressive surgical and adjuvant treatment.
