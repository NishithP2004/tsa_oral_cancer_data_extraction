This patient is a 60-year-old male who presented with oral cancer, diagnosed as a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, initially detected on 10/15/2012. The tumor was surgically removed through a modified radical neck dissection. Following this initial surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. Unfortunately, the patient experienced local recurrence of the cancer on 7/19/2013. Subsequent pathological examination revealed a stage N3b nodal involvement, indicating a significant spread of the disease. The tumor was classified as T2 at the time of initial surgery. Despite the initial surgical intervention and adjuvant therapy, the cancer progression necessitated further intervention. At the last documented follow-up, the state of the patient remains undefined.
