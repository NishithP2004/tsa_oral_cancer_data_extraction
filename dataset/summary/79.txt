This patient is a 48-year-old male who presented with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed following surgery on April 18, 2013. The initial tumor was classified as T2, indicating a local invasion. Following the initial surgery, a selective neck dissection was performed (levels 1-4). Pathological examination revealed no nodal involvement (N0). Subsequently, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the tumor, and further nodal recurrence. Despite adjuvant therapy, which was not specified in the provided records, the patient ultimately succumbed to other causes on his last follow-up date of August 18, 2014. The tumor was located ipsilaterally. While initially classified as T2, the final pathological staging, according to the 8th edition, was T3, reflecting a larger tumor and likely involvement of deeper tissues. The case highlights the challenges of managing locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma, even with aggressive surgical and adjuvant treatment.
