This patient is a 31-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on pathology following surgical resection performed on June 28, 2018. The initial tumor was classified as T4a, indicating extensive local involvement, and staged as N2b, indicating the involvement of the neck nodes. A selective neck dissection was performed. Following the initial surgery, the patient experienced local recurrence, with nodal recurrence also occurring. Subsequent pathological staging confirmed the tumor as N3b, signifying a greater extent of nodal spread. Despite the aggressive nature of the disease and the significant nodal involvement, the patient's last follow-up on December 15, 2018, reported no evidence of disease. The bilateral surgery suggests a significant and widespread involvement of the tongue and surrounding neck tissues.
