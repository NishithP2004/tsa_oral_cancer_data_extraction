The patient is a 28-year-old male who presented with a floor of mouth oral squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed on July 16, 2015. The tumor was classified as moderately differentiated and was staged clinically as T4a, indicating a significant local invasion. Following surgical resection involving a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4), the patient underwent adjuvant therapy. Despite this initial treatment, the cancer recurred on August 29, 2018, demonstrating local recurrence. Subsequent nodal examination revealed no undefined nodes, and the nodal status was initially classified as N0. The patientâ€™s final follow-up was January 1, 2019, at which point he was unfortunately found to be deceased with disease. This case highlights the aggressive nature of the oral squamous cell carcinoma and the challenges associated with managing local recurrence and subsequent disease progression.
