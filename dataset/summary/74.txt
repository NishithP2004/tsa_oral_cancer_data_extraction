This patient is a 68-year-old female who presented with an alveolus-based well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed on 2/19/2013. The initial tumor was classified as T4a, indicating an aggressive local invasion, and staged as N2c (meaning a significant number of regional lymph nodes involved). A selective neck dissection was performed. Despite this, the cancer recurred locally and with regional nodal involvement. Following the initial surgery, the patient received no adjuvant therapy. Subsequent follow-up on 1/17/2022 revealed no evidence of disease. However, pathological examination at the time of recurrence confirmed N0 nodal involvement, which is a discrepancy that warrants careful consideration. The bilateral nature of the initial surgery, combined with the T4a and N2c staging, highlights a complex and challenging case of oral cancer requiring ongoing monitoring.
