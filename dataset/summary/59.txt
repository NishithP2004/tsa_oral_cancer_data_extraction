The patient is a 53-year-old male who presented with a floor of mouth oral squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed on 8/6/2018. The tumor was classified as moderately differentiated and was staged clinically as T2. Following surgical resection involving a selective neck dissection (1-4 levels), the patient experienced local recurrence. Subsequent pathological examination confirmed nodal involvement, classified as N2b, and the cancer had spread to multiple lymph nodes. The patient subsequently received adjuvant therapy. At the last follow-up on 1/30/2020, the patient remained alive with disease. The overall progression indicates a substantial metastatic spread involving the neck nodes. Further details regarding specific adjuvant therapies and the precise extent of the metastasis require additional documentation.
