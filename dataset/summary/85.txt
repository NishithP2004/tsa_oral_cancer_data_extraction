This patient is a 73-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the retromolar trigone, diagnosed on December 2nd, 2013. The tumor was classified as T4a, indicating extensive local invasion. Given this assessment, a selective neck dissection was performed. Pathological examination revealed no nodal involvement (N0). Following initial surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. However, the patient experienced a local recurrence, documented on [Date of Local Recurrence - information missing in provided text]. Subsequently, nodal recurrence also occurred ([Date of Nodal recurrence - information missing in provided text]). The final follow-up was conducted on January 8th, 2014, at which point there was no evidence of disease. This case represents a challenging situation with initial localized extent followed by recurrence, highlighting the importance of close surveillance and potentially, further treatment options at the time of recurrence based on updated staging and therapeutic advances.
