This patient is a 47-year-old male who presented with oral cancer, diagnosed as a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. The initial surgical intervention, performed on March 24, 2015, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Pathology revealed an invasive tumor consistent with the 8th edition staging system as T4a and N2a. Following the initial surgery, adjuvant therapy was not administered. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence, and subsequently nodal recurrence. The last documented follow-up was June 20, 2016, at which point the patient was unfortunately found to be deceased with disease. The surgery was performed bilaterally.
