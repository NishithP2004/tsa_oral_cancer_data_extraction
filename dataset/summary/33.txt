This patient is a 66-year-old male who presented with oral cancer, diagnosed as a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. The initial surgery, performed on March 6, 2014, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns about potential nodal involvement. Pathology revealed a T1 tumor staging, indicating a localized primary tumor. Importantly, the initial pathology demonstrated no nodal involvement (N0). Following surgery, the patient received no adjuvant therapy. However, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the disease. Subsequent investigation revealed nodal recurrence as well, confirmed by the 8th edition nodal staging. The last follow-up was conducted on July 13, 2021, and at that time, there was no evidence of disease. The surgery was performed bilaterally. Overall, this case represents a challenging presentation of oral squamous cell carcinoma with initial localized disease progressing to nodal recurrence.
