This patient is a 68-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the alveolus. The initial surgery, performed on December 20, 2012, involved a selective neck dissection and was deemed a T4a stage according to the 8th edition clinical tumor staging system. Notably, the patient experienced local recurrence on June 6, 2013, and nodal recurrence on the same date. Further pathological examination confirmed a N3b nodal involvement. Despite adjuvant therapy, the patient ultimately succumbed to the disease, with the final documented state being ‘died with disease’ at last follow-up on June 6, 2014. The surgery was performed bilaterally.
