This patient is a 56-year-old female who presented with an alveolus-based well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed on 1/31/2017. The initial tumor was classified as T4a, indicating an advanced stage with significant involvement. Following surgical resection, a selective neck dissection was performed (levels 1-4). Pathological examination revealed an N0 nodal status, suggesting no detectable spread at the time of initial surgery. The patient subsequently experienced local recurrence, with the date of recurrence not specified in this record. Additionally, she experienced nodal recurrence. Despite adjuvant therapy, she ultimately presented with no evidence of disease at her last follow-up on 3/14/2017, although the specific details of the adjuvant treatment are not available. The surgery was performed bilaterally.
