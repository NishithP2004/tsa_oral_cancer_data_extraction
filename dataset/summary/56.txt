This patient is a 43-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on 11/14/2016. The initial tumor was classified as T2 clinically and later confirmed as T3 pathologically, indicating an invasive tumor. The cancer was located bilaterally within the neck, resulting in a clinically classified N2c nodal involvement, and confirmed as N2a pathologically. Following surgical resection involving a selective neck dissection, the patient experienced a local recurrence on 7/1/2017. Despite adjuvant therapy, the disease progressed. Unfortunately, the patient ultimately succumbed to the disease with metastatic disease, as confirmed at his last follow-up on 11/25/2017.
