This patient is a 43-year-old male diagnosed with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, initially detected through surgical intervention on February 11, 2021. The tumor was classified as T3, indicating an invasive growth with local extension, and N1, signifying involvement of regional lymph nodes. Following the initial surgery and selective neck dissection, the patient underwent adjuvant therapy. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the oral cancer. Subsequent follow-up revealed nodal recurrence as well. Despite this progression, the most recent follow-up on May 20, 2022, reported no evidence of disease, suggesting that the current status is stable at the time of last observation.
