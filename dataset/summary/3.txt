This 51-year-old female patient presented with oral cancer, diagnosed as a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, located on the tongue. The initial surgery, performed on September 24, 2019, involved a radical neck dissection, indicating a significant concern about potential metastasis. Pathology confirmed the diagnosis and revealed a T3 tumor stage. Critically, the initial surgery also identified N3b nodal involvement, signifying the spread of the disease to multiple levels of the neck. Following the initial surgery, adjuvant therapy was administered. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence. Subsequent follow-up revealed nodal recurrence as well. The final follow-up was conducted on February 19, 2020, and at that time, there was no evidence of disease. Despite the initial aggressive treatment strategy and recurrence, the patient remained without evidence of disease at the last documented follow-up.
