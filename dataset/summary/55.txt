This 42-year-old male patient presented with oral cancer, initially diagnosed as a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. The primary tumor was surgically removed on June 13, 2019. Following the initial surgery, a selective neck dissection was performed (levels 1-4). Subsequently, adjuvant therapy was initiated. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the disease on May 8, 2020. Further investigation revealed nodal involvement (N2b) at the time of recurrence. Despite this, the pathological examination of the recurrence revealed no nodal metastases (N0). The patientâ€™s final follow-up was also on May 8, 2020, and he ultimately succumbed to his disease with metastatic disease. The tumor's initial staging according to the 8th Edition was T4a, indicating a large and aggressive tumor. The surgery was performed bilaterally.
