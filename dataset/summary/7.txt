This patient is a 54-year-old male diagnosed with well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, initially identified on 8/11/2020. The tumor was surgically resected with a modified radical neck dissection, indicating a significant regional involvement necessitating this approach. Pathology revealed a T4a staging – representing a large tumor with potential invasion into deeper tissues and/or extraliminal extension – and N3b staging, signifying the involvement of multiple levels of the neck lymph nodes. Following the initial surgery, adjuvant therapy was administered. Subsequent follow-up, completed on 3/5/2021, revealed local recurrence of the tumor and nodal recurrence, confirming a N2a staging. Importantly, at the time of last follow-up, there was no evidence of disease (No Evidence of Disease – NED) status. This case demonstrates a challenging course of oral cancer progression requiring extensive surgical intervention and subsequent monitoring.
