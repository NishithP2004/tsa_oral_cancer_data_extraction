This 60-year-old male patient presented with oral cancer, initially diagnosed as a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. The tumor was staged as T4a and N2c, indicating extensive local invasion and nodal involvement, specifically affecting the neck. The patient underwent a selective neck dissection on 10/27/2016, followed by adjuvant therapy. Unfortunately, the cancer recurred locally, and subsequently, the lymph node metastases also returned. The last follow-up, conducted on 4/28/2022, revealed no evidence of disease. Itâ€™s important to note the bilateral nature of the nodal recurrence.
