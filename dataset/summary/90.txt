This patient is a 78-year-old male who presented with oral cancer, specifically a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. The initial surgery, performed on February 17, 2011, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns about regional lymph node involvement. Pathology revealed a T1 tumor stage and an N2a nodal stage, indicating metastasis to the neck lymph nodes. Following the initial surgery, the patient underwent adjuvant therapy (though details are not provided in this summary). Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the oral cancer, followed by nodal recurrence. The last follow-up was conducted on April 2, 2011, at which point there was no evidence of disease. This case represents a challenging instance of oral cancer progression, necessitating aggressive initial surgical intervention and subsequent monitoring.
