This patient is a 42-year-old female who presented with a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on November 9th, 2016. The initial tumor was classified as T3, indicating extensive local involvement, and N0, signifying no nodal involvement at the time of initial diagnosis. Following surgical resection, including a selective neck dissection (1-4), the patient underwent adjuvant therapy. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the tumor on the tongue. Subsequently, she developed nodal recurrence, necessitating further surgical intervention. Despite adjuvant treatment and ongoing follow-up until May 6th, 2022, there was no evidence of disease detected. The clinical staging, according to the 8th Edition, was consistently T3 and N0 prior to recurrence.
