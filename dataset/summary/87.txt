This patient is a 48-year-old male who presented with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on March 31, 2013. The initial tumor was classified as T3, indicating invasion into deeper tissues, and N1, signifying involvement of regional lymph nodes. Following surgical resection, including a selective neck dissection, the patient underwent adjuvant therapy. Unfortunately, the cancer recurred locally, and subsequently, nodal recurrence was also documented. The final follow-up was conducted on May 29, 2013, at which time there was no evidence of disease. The initial tumor was classified as T4a, indicating a more extensive invasion. Despite the aggressive nature of the initial diagnosis and recurrence, the patient demonstrated no evidence of disease at the time of last follow-up.
