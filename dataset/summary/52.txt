This 53-year-old male patient presented with oral cancer, initially diagnosed as poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. The initial surgery, performed on February 24, 2015, involved a selective neck dissection with levels 1-4. Subsequent pathological examination revealed a tumor stage of T4a and N3b, indicating advanced disease with significant regional lymph node involvement. Following the initial surgery, the patient experienced a local recurrence, necessitating further treatment. Despite adjuvant therapy, the disease progressed, ultimately leading to his death with disease. The last follow-up was recorded as November 25, 2015. Bilateral neck dissection was performed as part of the treatment plan.
