This 35-year-old male presented with a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed following surgical resection performed on February 18, 2021. The initial pathology revealed a T3 stage tumor, indicating local invasion and involvement of surrounding tissues, and an N2b nodal status, signifying metastasis to level II and III lymph nodes. A selective neck dissection was performed as part of the initial surgical treatment. Following the surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence, followed by nodal recurrence. The last follow-up was conducted on August 17, 2021, at which point he was alive with disease, indicating continued progression of the cancer. Bilateral neck dissection was performed. The patient's case reflects a challenging presentation of oral squamous cell carcinoma with significant local and nodal involvement, despite initial surgical intervention and adjuvant treatment.
