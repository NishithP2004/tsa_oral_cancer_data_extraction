This 54-year-old male patient presented with oral cancer, diagnosed as a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. The initial surgery, performed on March 15, 2022, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns about potential lymph node involvement. Pathological examination revealed the tumor to be T4a and N2c, indicating significant tumor size and regional lymph node involvement. Following the initial surgery, adjuvant therapy was administered. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the cancer. Subsequently, he developed nodal recurrence as well. The last follow-up was conducted on November 8, 2021, at which point there was no evidence of disease. The surgery was performed bilaterally. Despite initial treatment, the patientâ€™s case demonstrates a challenging course with local and nodal recurrence requiring ongoing monitoring.
