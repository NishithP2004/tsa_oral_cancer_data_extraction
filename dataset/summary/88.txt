This patient is a 60-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed through pathology on 10/22/2012. The initial tumor was classified as T2, indicating a local invasion. Due to the involvement of regional lymph nodes, a selective neck dissection was performed. Pathologically, the node status was N0, signifying no nodal involvement at the time of initial surgery. Following this, the patient underwent adjuvant therapy, although the specific details are not provided. Subsequently, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the oral cancer. Further investigation revealed nodal recurrence as well. The final follow-up was conducted on 12/3/2012, at which point there was no evidence of disease. The surgery was performed on the ipsilateral side of the tongue.
