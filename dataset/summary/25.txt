This patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with oral cancer, specifically a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the floor of the mouth. The initial surgery, performed on March 13, 2018, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Pathological staging at the time of surgery was N0 and T1, indicating a localized tumor with no detectable nodal involvement. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was not administered. Subsequently, the patient experienced local recurrence of the oral cancer. The exact date of recurrence is not specified in the provided information, however, it's documented as a later recurrence. Furthermore, the patient also experienced nodal recurrence. The final follow-up was conducted on December 7, 2020, and at that point, there was no evidence of disease. The presentation was consistent with a T1, N0 initial tumor, followed by local recurrence and nodal involvement during the course of treatment.
