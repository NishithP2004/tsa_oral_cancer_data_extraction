This patient is a 67-year-old female who presented with oral cancer, diagnosed as a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. The initial surgery, performed on April 30, 2013, involved selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Pathology revealed a T2 tumor, and importantly, no nodal involvement (N0). Following the initial surgery, the patient experienced a local recurrence. Subsequently, nodal recurrence was observed. The final follow-up was recorded on December 30, 2013, at which point there was no evidence of disease. The surgery was performed on the ipsilateral side. This case represents a typical presentation of oral squamous cell carcinoma with initial surgical management and subsequent local recurrence requiring nodal evaluation.
