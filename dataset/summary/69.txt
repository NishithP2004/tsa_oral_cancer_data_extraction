This patient is a 56-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa. The primary tumor was diagnosed on October 10, 2018, and was classified as T4a, indicating a large tumor with potential invasion into deeper tissues and/or structures. Given the involvement, a selective neck dissection was performed, resulting in a nodal stage of N2b (unspecified). Following initial surgical resection, the patient received adjuvant therapy. Unfortunately, the cancer recurred locally, and subsequently, nodal recurrence was also observed. The final follow-up was conducted on September 1, 2021, at which point there was no evidence of disease. Despite aggressive treatment, including surgery and adjuvant therapy, the patient experienced a complex course of oral cancer progression, characterized by initial primary tumor growth, regional lymph node involvement, and eventual local recurrence.
