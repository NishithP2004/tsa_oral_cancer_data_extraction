This patient is a 60-year-old female who presented with oral cancer, specifically a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, located on the tongue. The initial surgery, performed on November 5, 2012, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns about potential nodal involvement. Pathological examination revealed the tumor to be T3, indicating a larger tumor size and invasion into deeper tissues, and N0, signifying no detectable nodal involvement at the time of the initial surgery. Following this initial resection, adjuvant therapy was not administered. However, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the oral cancer. Subsequently, nodal recurrence was also identified. The final follow-up was conducted on January 3, 2013, at which point there was no evidence of disease. The surgery was performed on the ipsilateral side of the tongue.
