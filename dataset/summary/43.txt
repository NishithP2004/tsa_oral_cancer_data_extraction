This 52-year-old male patient presented with oral cancer, specifically a verrucous carcinoma, located on the tongue. The initial surgery, performed on April 13, 2020, involved selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Following this, adjuvant therapy was initiated. Pathological examination revealed a locally advanced tumor, classified as T4a, and extensive nodal involvement, categorized as N3b, extending bilaterally. Despite the aggressive nature of the disease and extensive surgical resection, the patient experienced a local recurrence and nodal recurrence. Last follow-up was recorded as August 24, 2020, at which point he was deceased due to causes unrelated to his cancer. This case represents a challenging presentation of verrucous carcinoma with significant local and nodal extension, ultimately proving fatal.
