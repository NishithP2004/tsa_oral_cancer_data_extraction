This patient is a 48-year-old male who presented with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma arising from the buccal mucosa. The initial surgery, performed on January 15, 2020, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns about potential nodal involvement. Pathology revealed a T2 stage tumor. Importantly, the initial pathological examination showed no evidence of nodal involvement (N0). Following this surgery, the patient experienced a local recurrence, documented on [Date of Nodal recurrence - *Please insert date here*]. Subsequent follow-up, concluded on December 12, 2020, indicated no evidence of disease. It's crucial to note that the progression of this case highlights the potential for local recurrence with squamous cell carcinomas, necessitating close monitoring and continued evaluation.
