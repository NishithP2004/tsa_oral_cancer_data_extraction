This patient is a 60-year-old female who presented with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa, diagnosed on 7/11/2013. The initial tumor was classified as T4a, indicating extensive local invasion. Consequently, a selective neck dissection was performed. Pathological examination revealed no nodal involvement (N0). Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was administered. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the cancer. Subsequently, nodal recurrence was also observed. The last follow-up was conducted on 3/11/2014, at which point no evidence of disease was present. Bilateral neck dissection was performed. The cancer remained confined to the buccal mucosa despite the aggressive initial staging and subsequent recurrence.
