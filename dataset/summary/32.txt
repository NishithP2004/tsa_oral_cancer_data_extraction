This patient is a 66-year-old male who presented with a floor of mouth oral squamous cell carcinoma, diagnosed on April 29, 2016. The tumor was classified as moderately differentiated and was staged as T3 at the time of initial surgery, indicating a locally advanced tumor. Concurrent with the initial surgery, a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) was performed, and the nodal status was classified as N0, meaning no regional lymph node involvement at the time of diagnosis. Following the initial surgery, adjuvant therapy was administered. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the oral cancer. Subsequent investigation revealed nodal recurrence as well. The last follow-up was conducted on March 4, 2022, and at that time, no evidence of disease was observed. This case demonstrates a significant progression of the oral cancer, initially classified as T3, with subsequent local recurrence and nodal metastasis, ultimately managed with continued surveillance.
