This 76-year-old male patient presented with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma originating in the alveolus of the mouth. The initial surgical intervention, performed on April 16, 2020, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4), indicating a concern for potential nodal involvement. Pathology revealed a T4a tumor, signifying a large tumor with local extension, and N2a nodal involvement – meaning the cancer had spread to adjacent lymph nodes. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence, and subsequently nodal recurrence. The last follow-up was recorded as July 24, 2020, at which point there was no evidence of disease. Despite initial aggressive treatment, including surgical intervention and adjuvant therapy, the patient’s case highlights the challenges associated with managing locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma with significant nodal involvement.
