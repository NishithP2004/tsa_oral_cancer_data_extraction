This patient is a 67-year-old male diagnosed with well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, initially identified following surgical intervention performed on December 24, 2020. The tumor was staged clinically as T1, indicating a small primary lesion. The initial surgical approach involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) as part of the staging process. Pathological examination revealed an N0 nodal status, signifying no detectable cancer cells in the regional lymph nodes. Following the initial surgery, the patient underwent adjuvant therapy, though the specific details are not provided in this summary.  Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the oral cancer. Subsequent follow-up on March 27, 2021, revealed no evidence of disease. This case highlights the potential for local recurrence following initial treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma and emphasizes the importance of continued surveillance.
