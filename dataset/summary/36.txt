This patient is a 53-year-old female who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa. The primary tumor was diagnosed on April 20, 2017, and was staged clinically as T4a, indicating a large tumor with involvement of deeper tissues and potentially adjacent structures. Following surgical resection involving a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4), the initial pathological findings revealed a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with no nodal involvement (N0) as defined by the 8th Edition staging system. However, the patient subsequently experienced local recurrence of the oral cancer. Furthermore, there was evidence of nodal recurrence, although the exact timeline for this recurrence is not explicitly stated. The last documented follow-up was November 20, 2017, at which time there was no evidence of disease. The surgery was performed bilaterally. Despite the initial N0 staging and complete resection, the patientâ€™s case highlights the potential for recurrence of oral squamous cell carcinoma, emphasizing the importance of vigilant follow-up and consideration of adjuvant therapies, particularly given the T4a primary staging.
