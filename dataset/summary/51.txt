This patient is a 34-year-old female presenting with a history of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on November 26, 2020. The initial tumor was classified as T4a, indicating a large tumor with potential invasion into adjacent structures. Following surgical resection involving a selective neck dissection (1-4 levels), the patient experienced local recurrence. Subsequently, nodal recurrence was also identified, classified as N2b. The patient underwent adjuvant therapy, presumably following the initial resection and nodal involvement. At the last follow-up on September 10, 2021, there was no evidence of disease. This case demonstrates a challenging scenario of oral cancer with initial local recurrence and nodal spread, necessitating aggressive treatment and continued surveillance.
