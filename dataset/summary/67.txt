This patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with oral cancer, specifically a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. The initial surgery, performed on June 18, 2018, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns about potential lymph node involvement. Pathological examination revealed a T2 tumor stage. Importantly, the initial pathological examination indicated no nodal involvement (N0). However, subsequent follow-up revealed local recurrence of the tumor and nodal recurrence (N1 status currently undefined). The last documented follow-up was on December 1, 2020, at which point there was no evidence of disease. The surgical procedure was performed bilaterally. Further investigation is warranted to determine the precise N1 status and guide appropriate treatment decisions given the progression of the disease.
