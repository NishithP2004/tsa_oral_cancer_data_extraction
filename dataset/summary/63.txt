This patient is a 57-year-old female who presented with oral cancer, diagnosed as a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue. The initial surgery, performed on November 11, 2018, involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4) due to concerns about potential metastasis. Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Subsequent pathological examination revealed no nodal involvement (N0) at the primary site. However, following local recurrence, a bilateral neck dissection was performed. The final pathological staging according to the 8th edition was T2 N2c. Despite adjuvant therapy, the patient experienced local recurrence. The last follow-up was conducted on March 3, 2021, with no evidence of disease detected at that time. The recurrence occurred on the tongue, indicating a persistent local challenge with the tumor.
