This patient is a 63-year-old male who underwent surgery on January 27, 2015, for a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. The initial surgical intervention involved a selective neck dissection, removing lymph nodes 1 through 4. Following this, adjuvant therapy was initiated. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the tumor. Subsequently, he also developed nodal recurrence, classified as N1 and N3b according to the 8th edition staging system. The pathological examination revealed a T4a tumor. Despite the aggressive nature of the disease and the extent of the nodal involvement, the patient was last followed up on May 1, 2022, with no evidence of disease present at that time. The bilateral surgery underscores the significant extent of the initial tumor and the subsequent spread of the cancer. While the final follow-up was positive, the patientâ€™s case highlights the challenges associated with managing locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma.
