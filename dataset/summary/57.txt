This patient is a 62-year-old male who presented with oral cancer originating on the tongue. On May 15, 2020, a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma was surgically removed. The initial surgical approach involved a selective neck dissection (levels 1-4). Pathology revealed a T2 tumor, indicating a tumor size of approximately 2-4 centimeters, and an N0 nodal stage, signifying no detectable nodal involvement at the time of initial surgery. However, the patient experienced a local recurrence, documented on [Date of Local Recurrence - needs to be filled in], indicating persistence of the primary tumor. Subsequently, he also experienced nodal recurrence, documented on [Date of Nodal Recurrence - needs to be filled in], suggesting metastasis to regional lymph nodes, classified as N2b. Despite this, the patient's last follow-up on June 2, 2021, reported no evidence of disease. The surgery was performed bilaterally. This case highlights a challenging course of moderately differentiated oral squamous cell carcinoma, with initial apparent negative nodal status followed by local and regional recurrence, ultimately remaining under observation with no evidence of disease at the last reported follow-up.
