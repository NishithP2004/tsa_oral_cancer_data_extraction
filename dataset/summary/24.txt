This 43-year-old female patient presented with oral cancer, specifically a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, located on the tongue. The initial diagnosis, made on March 12, 2020, indicated a T2 tumor stage, reflecting the size and extent of the primary lesion. Following surgical resection, a selective neck dissection was performed (levels 1-4), with a pathological nodal status of N0, indicating no evidence of nodal involvement at the time of surgery. Subsequently, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the oral cancer. Notably, there was also a documented nodal recurrence, though the exact date is not specified in the provided summary. The last follow-up was conducted on August 26, 2022, at which point there was no evidence of disease progression. The surgery was performed bilaterally.  The final pathological stage, according to the 8th edition, was classified as T2. This case represents a challenging scenario of oral cancer with initial localized disease progression and subsequent recurrence necessitating further management consideration.
