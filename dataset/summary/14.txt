This patient is a 45-year-old female presenting with a history of moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on December 18, 2018. The initial tumor was classified as T1, indicating a localized primary lesion. Following surgical resection utilizing a modified radical neck dissection, the patient experienced local recurrence. Subsequent nodal involvement, classified as N2b, was also identified. Despite this, the pathological stage according to the 8th edition was initially reported as N0. A later pathological review confirmed N2b nodal involvement. At the last follow-up on October 25, 2021, there was no evidence of disease. The surgery was performed on the ipsilateral side. This case represents a complex progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma with initial local invasion followed by nodal metastasis, ultimately treated with a modified radical neck dissection. Continued surveillance remains crucial to monitor for any potential recurrence.
