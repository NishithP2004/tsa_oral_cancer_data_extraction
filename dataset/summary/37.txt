This patient is a 43-year-old male who presented with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, diagnosed on December 1st, 2014. The initial tumor was classified as T4a, indicating extensive local invasion, and was accompanied by N2b nodal involvement, signifying a significant spread to adjacent lymph nodes. Following initial surgical resection, a selective neck dissection was performed, removing lymph nodes 1-4. Due to the aggressive nature of the disease, adjuvant therapy was not administered. Subsequently, the patient experienced a local recurrence of the oral cancer, and further nodal recurrence occurred. The final follow-up, recorded on June 1st, 2015, revealed no evidence of disease. This case represents a challenging scenario of a locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma with extensive nodal involvement, highlighting the need for aggressive initial surgical intervention and careful long-term surveillance.
