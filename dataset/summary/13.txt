This 54-year-old male patient presented with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa, diagnosed on March 5th, 2012. The initial surgical intervention involved a modified radical neck dissection, performed ipsilaterally. Pathological staging at the time of surgery indicated a T3 tumor and N0 nodal involvement according to the 8th edition staging system. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy was initiated. Subsequently, the patient experienced local recurrence of the oral cancer. Further investigation revealed nodal recurrence as well. The final follow-up was conducted on January 9th, 2013, at which point there was no evidence of disease. This case highlights the aggressive nature of oral squamous cell carcinoma and the importance of complete surgical resection and adjuvant therapy in improving patient outcomes, even with subsequent local recurrence.
