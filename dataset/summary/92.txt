This patient is a 83-year-old male who presented with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa. The initial diagnosis, made on November 9th, 2015, indicated a T4a tumor stage, signifying a large and invasive primary tumor. Following surgical resection, a selective neck dissection was performed (levels 1-4), with no undefined nodes identified. Pathological staging revealed an N0 status, indicating no regional lymph node involvement at the time of initial diagnosis. The patient subsequently experienced a local recurrence, followed by nodal recurrence. Despite this progression, the patient remained under observation until his last follow-up on January 9th, 2016, at which point he was declared dead due to other causes. The complete clinical course reflects a significant challenge with this aggressive squamous cell carcinoma, highlighting the importance of meticulous surgical resection and ongoing surveillance in patients with this diagnosis.
